5,Excellent Service
5,The food here available is very good quality and also very tasty. I am always regular customer for this hotel. It's really maintained well and very clean. Regarding the rates it's very reasonable also. So overall it's a good restaurant to all food lovers
4,"Small South Indian restaurant next to My office. One should stand and eat.if you love panner then definitely you should try ""panner in green pepper sauce"".it really tastes yummy.panner pepper dry which they serve is equally good.Update- Today Tried baby corn lollipop here and it was lip. Smacking."
5,No words for the paneer...one of the few places where u get authentic paneer dishes... Hotel staff are really good and the food quality is very very good...Parking : 2 wheeler and 4 wheeler availablePayment mode : Cash and cardNext time will try out pastries !!!
5,Newly opened cafe near KIMS Medical College.Spacious and pleasant ambiance.Must try Chicken Pakoda and Crispy Fried Chicken.Sheesha happy hours offers are good and affordable.
5,"I personally really liked this place ! The ambience with the rooftop , plants , the music is great !The starters are good and so were the pizzas.The prices are pretty affordable! Must visit place !"
5,Very good pizza... took unlimited pizza and could eat 3 pizzas easily per person... even service is very good... staff is very courteous and polite
4,Onward has been a favourite place for a Pizza for quite some time. Their Happy Hour Pizzas and Pizza Combos are to be relished. The pizzas are fluffy and have just the right amount of sauce and toppings to cheer you up.
3,Onesta serves unlimited pizza and desserts with pasta alsoThis places has multiple branches in the city and usually crowded on weekendsService: itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs good and decentPrices : affordableFood: desserts and shakes are very goodBut the pizzas are too thick base ones so until you order something very cheesy or with a generous topping canÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât taste itThe choclate banana pizza was a disappointment as was very raw
4,"I like going back to this place. I really like the ambience and the fact that it is a rooftop makes it a cool place to hangout. Although, I keep ordering almost the same thing every time, it has always turned out to be a nice experience. This place is famous for its pizza but, I kinda like their pasta more. Also, the tiramisu shots are to die for and so is the mozzarella cheese balls with a really generous amount of cheese inside. I would surely recommend this place and I would definitely keep going back."
5,"Bakasuras Paradise!The only place that can keep the bakasuras belly happy!My 6th visit, and my 5th different onesta visit!From RR nagar, JP Nagar, Basavanagudi, Koramangala bakasura ended up at an onesta in Banashankari as well!Every visit , it's the unlimited meal that I have had. But, but, but there is a change that's happening. From unlimited pizza, unlimited dessert and a beverage (mocktails and everything) to unlimited pizza, one dessert and one aerated beverage (coke/Pepsi/fanta) , I have been through all! And yet, it never disappoints!The pizzas here are just fab and you can hardly eat like 4-5 pizzas in one sitting (bakasura can.. can you? Yes you can)Coming to the staff, they are great.Coming to the quality, it's great.To finish!Be like onesta!It's Bakasura RecommendedFood- 10/10Ambience- 10/10Staff- 10/10Value for money- 25/10Onesta Love!"
4,It is like any other onesta outlet. But I find this outlet more crowded than any other outlet that I have visited so far. Food wise it's the same no much of difference. But since the place a little huge service is delayed usually.
5,"At times of a cafe bubble in Bangalore, Onesta truly stands out as one the best restaurants with great food, pocket friendly menu and excellent staff. The place often has offers providing unlimited pizzas at prices as low as Rs 150. I have been here multiple times , tasted most of the items on menu and not once have I returned unsatisfied."
5,"This is one of the biggest Onesta outlets I've visited. In the last couple of years, Onesta has made a name for itself. We did not have pizza places that have a buffet option.Like any other Onesta, the taste is right up there and the quick service. I like the thin crust pizzas here. I'd recommend you to take the buffet, ordering a la carte is not pocket friendly."
5,"This roof top outlet of OnestÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ  is one of the amazing places to have the best pizzas in and around Banashankari.Not only the ambience but also the cheerful yet humble service staff catalised my great experience there.Must try: chat pizza, herbed wedges#rajeshwrites"
4,"This is one of the best restaurants in banglore this is a roof top restaurant with a very good ambiance!This is a peaceful place where u can seat chat with your friends with very good starters , drinks , and off course pizzas .They serve these tiny little desserts which look good . Personal favourite was cheese balls and fish fingers .I love the service here itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs quick even during the offers their service is pretty fast."
5,"Food : 4/5Service: 10/5So let's get over the food and the ambience first. Restaurant is big, with high roof, give a sense of space, well lit. Food is great, not mind blowing. We took the unlimited menu, and loved the bacon pizza most. Rest of the pizza was good enough. Among the deserts, the walnut tart was superb, but i didn't like the peanut-butter mousse at all.But, in spite of all that, the reason for the 5-star rating is the service we got. We were served by Mr.Nanda, who made us feel absolutely special. He didn't have to. We were a small party of just two people, we weren't ordering off the main menu, and the restaurant discourages tips. In spite of all that, he was extremely attentive (without being intrusive), engaging and helpful. I have been to quite some places, from roadside ones to five-star hotels, rarely have the service been so heart warmingly good. I hope he goes onto much much greater things in life, because he is absolutely brilliant at his work."
4,"Ambiance - 4/5Service - 4/5Food - 4/5Great pizza, served hot and made to order. They take note of what crusts you want for your pizza and I had the thin crust, so I could eat more, and the crust was made amazing also so was the pizza.The service is really good and the place is clean also. All in all wonderful place and another great restaurant part of the franchise."
4,"Loved the foodie experience here!!!!!! Came here for the name of the week offer and trust me I was disappointed. This whole place has such a good ambience that u l love it instantly.Crazy Bangalore rain and Fresh piping hot pizza and the night is sorted!Unlimited pizzas, a mocktail and did i just hear unlimited desserts?!Goodbye midweek blues!!!?I would specially mention the staff here-Chaitanya,Arup and Binita serving us, they were all so friendly and courteous, never have i had such an experience.What really makes your food enjoyable is just not the taste but how the person served you!Top notch guys!!Coming back for more-offer or no offer ! ?"
5,"The best buffet with unbelievably awesome service, a great ambience and the best food.The desserts and drinks are up to the mark too and its reasonably priced too."
4,"Food quality 4.5/5Hospitality 4/5Management response 4.5/5Cleanliness 4.5/5Ordered1) Assorted Bruschetta - It included Tomato Delight, Herbed Mushroom and Broccoli and cheese Bruschetta.2) Mexican Veg Delight pizza - It was topped with some Bell peppers, onion and some Cherry Tomato.3) Farmhouse Special- Topped with Baby corn, Bell pepper and mushroom4)Virgin Mojitos - Mint, Lime and sprit were main ingredients.5) Kiwi & Basil Fizz - Kiwi syrup, Basil leaves and sprit.6)Caramel Walnut Tart7) Chilli chocolate tart8) Baked Cherry Cheesecake9)Penne Al Pesto"
4,Taste of the food is good and the ambience as well. They need to reduce the price or increase the quality and quantity. There need to be also more options or items of food. They have maintained a very hygiene food and kitchen which is very appreciative.
5,"Visited last Saturday with my kids ,It was superb crowd .very good service and food ...kids loved the pasta ,pizzas and drinks ...Keep it continue onesta team ..."
3,I love onesta always and their unlimited offers. I had a really good experience in JP nagar but this outlet slightly disappointed me. You guys took a lot of time for our orders and food was okayish too. Hope you guys work on that.
3,This outlet of onesta is on the rooftop. It's has a nice chill ambience. Though the size of the pizzas are kinda small the ones with cream taste good. They ran out of desserts by 9pm which was pretty disappointing. The service was okay but can be improved.
5,"Friendly staffs , nice ambience colourful lights , hanging skeletons reasonable price , nice music gud for group of friends enjoyed a lot ??????"
4,Must experience..The service was impeccable.We were made to feel welcome and dishes very reasonably priced. Before we had even finished our plates we were planning the next time we would eat here.
4,"Hi... This is place to chill and experience different type of food. We recently visted and there was good treatment from staff n white sauce pasta , pizza , garlic bread stick, momos, was awesome. Great place."
5,Nice place to chill out and have a good time with friends. Nice ambience and good tasting food.Good selection of foods for both veg and non veg.
5,Awesome food ??Great serviceFriendly staffsGood quality of food# Complimentary Breakfast ??# Honey Lemon Chicken and Chicken Manchow SoupPerfect place too stay alone or with family ????Will stay whenever I will go Bangalore ????
5,Newly Launched Bar & Restaurant. Good Food quality. Like to visit again. Also like to suggest to others.Nice Ambiance and setting. Also outdoor dining is available. Did like the Chicken grill.
4,We ended up here on a Saturday afternoon after an hectic dayThe food was too goodThe ambience is okayBut usually itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs crowded with the college students aroundFood 4.5/5Ambience 4/5
4,"The food was amazing but they might need to work on the pizza and the crepes. The lighting is a little bit on the dimmer side, but the ambience is quite good because of the comic theme."
5,"Best waffles?? I am coming here from past 1 year! Good place to chill with friends! Good ambience, good food,!! Must visit place if youÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâre in and around Banashankari"
4,Food 4/5Ambience 3.5/5Staffs and service 4/5Cost 4/5Comic theme ambience with good food and service. Very calm and composed with lively environment ! Overall a very good place to hangout .... Loved it ?
4,"CafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå© which is very near to my home did outreach my expectations. I did like the ambience and service in this cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå©. Ordered Mango and Almond Smoothies with Potato Wedges, Pesto Veg Pasta. It was just lip smacking. Again, the next evening i took my wife to the same place and had Alfredo Veg Pasta, Chilly Baby Corn, French Fries, Black currant and Lychee Smoothees and turn out to be good. I recommend this place for my friends in my neighborhood!"
3,"This cute comic book themed cafe is one of the closest hangout places for college students. It is fun if you go with a group of friends. The food is kinda good but not that great. Pasta Alfredo has too much cheese which kinda starts making you sick of it. I don't know if that should be considered a good point or a bad one xD Also, I wish they gave garlic bread with pasta and not the regular one :( Pizza is okayish, pasta arrabiata is good. This place is famous for Chilli cheese Maggi and blue lagoon. They are super tasty but kinda overpriced. Sandwiches, waffles and nuggets are also pretty good.The place is really pretty, a good hangout place but nahhh, I wouldn't suggest you to go there if your sole purpose is to have good food."
3,"A good place to sit with a bunch of friends and hangout.. food tastes good and the service is also quick.But a boring place if u go with a just 1 or 2 people.Usually not crowded, and this place can be easily located while passing by."
4,Very good restaurant in neighbourhood. Buffet system is properly arranged. Variety of dishes along with garba dance and puppet show. Good spread of desserts. Live paratha / Kulcha making
4,"Great service, overwhelming experience.One of its kind experience. Grand village offers you some very desi food options.Jaljeera, buttermilk, chat papdi, bhajiya, dosa, pav bhaji, noodles, and so many curries kulcha, roti, and garama garam Jalebies, gulab jamuns.Beautiful ambience of village. People serving with smiles and with full heart !!So here goes my overall ratings :Food : 4/5Ambience : 3.5/5Service : 4/5Pocket friendly : 4/5"
4,This outlet is better than other outlets. But the service was slow. Ambience was good. The garlic bread was not that great. But the other dishes were yum.
1,"Quality of coffee has gone worse. So so so diluted coffee.. Though I ordered cold coffee, it was not at all cold. Even AC seemed to be off in this summer as we felt really hot through out our time. Instead of paying service taxes n getting horrible coffee n sweating, it's better to buy coke or drink water or visit better cafes."
3,It's a nice place to hangout because ambience is very relaxing. They serve different varieties of coffee. And recently they've added sandwiches burgers . But they're not UpTo the mark. The only thing I like here is toastizza!! Not worth the price.
3.5,"Good place to hangout with buddies, friendly staff but service could be improved. I ordered Cool Blue beverage, sizzle dazzle brownie and burger were so yummy. I would definitely recommend this place.Ambience : 3.5/5.Taste: 3.5/5.Service: 3.5/5.Quality: 3.5/5."
3.5,"Last month we visited this place , we had a small business meeting . The place is very nice and quiet . coffee was really good but unfortunately the burger was dry and stale."
3,"This Cafe Coffee Day is a stone's throw from my residence. It is better than other outlets in some ways, but also worse in others.The good stuff - This CCD is hardly, if ever, crowded. even on weekends, it's pretty easy to get a table. The hustle and bustle around the place is quite pleasing.Bow, the bad - The staff members here are quite dumb. They can't understand simple instructions, and often mess things up.Just like any other CCD.Food - 3/5Ambiance - 3.5/5Service -2.5/5Value for money - 3/5Hygiene - 3.5/5Overall - 3/5"
4.5,"Like Shubha has stated, this coffee day is different and holds a great value because it is in the area I usually hang out. I have been visiting CCD BSK since it opened. It has been my adda through school, junior college and I have even scheduled a couple of meetings there recently. What is so special here? The service! Yes coffee day has the order at the counter policy, but the staff at this one are extremely cheery and friendly. They always have a warm smile when they greet you and even suggest some different items to try. My favorite at coffee day has shifted from cappuccino to their Frosteas! Pomegranate and Lemon Frostea with a Tex Mex Sandwich! All enough to fill your belly!i like their ambience, and love interacting with their staff. Pretty much go there everyday!"
4,"I know this is like any other coffee days but since this is Katriguppe and My area ... I hold it very close to meI would want to visit this place any day anytime.. alone or with anybody for that matter and it sure does gimme a good feelMy personal favourite.. Hot cappuccino, Chilli cheese sandwich ( the combo ), a mango shot ( for a lil cold feel ),banana chips and some nice VH1 music else the manager, Mallesh is sweet enough to switch on the tv for us in case of any cricket matches being played that day...Many ppl don't like this cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå© maybe cause of traffic and the noise but I personally feel once you are seated inside/outside with your buddies comfortably..these things become trivial :)Try the new Veg wraps"
3.5,Cafe! best place to hang out wid best buddies:-*
4,"The food was quite good, we ordered chicken and eggfried rice which tasted pretty good.The service was as expected and the ambience was also good but it felt like as if we were in a pub but overall it was nice."
4,Hookah place !! It's a dark silent place.. people who prefer dark places can go there !! The food is good and tasty.. fries are good and neither too costly !! Parking sometimes can get us a problem !!
5,Hide out is best cafe and the staff members are very concerned best place to visit I love the place no other can beat this cafe awsum ????? loved it thanks for the convenience
5,"What a pleasant experience. Those saying overall good experience and yet giving 3* not fair. These people deserve genuine 5* for great food and ambience. Locality wise , music and atmosphere is awsmm. Plz guys u must pay a visit and encourage them. Loved it totally."
3,"Hideout cafe, located in hosakerehalli main road. The lounge is in underground, kinda creepy. Ambience is okay.The food in here is okay, but can do better. Hookah is very good. A pocket friendly cafe. When comes to the service, it's pleasing. Over all had a good experience."
5,"Best place!!I go there thrice a week!Good serving, nice hookah!Staff members are all friendly.Inertiors are mediumGood place!Bet place for time pass"
3,"A cave theme cafe, located in 100ft road Banashankari 3rd stage. Hide out cafe, The ambience is good, the lightings are good, very comfortable place to sit and eat.The parking place is available.The food in here is okay, but can do better. Hookah is very good. A pocket friendly cafe. When comes to the service, it's pleasing.Food-3/5.Ambience-3.5/5.Service-4/5."
3,"Hideout cafe, located in hosakerehalli. The lounge is in underground, kinda creepy. Ambience is okay. Me and my friends wanted to visit this place from a long time, one fine day we hopped in. We ordered1). Hookah- panras+grapemint.2). Cheese potato kurkure- okayish.3). Chicken nachoes- okayish.Hookah was good and the waiters were friendly. They have to improve their taste in foods. Other than that its worth a visit.Ambience:3/5Service: 4/5Food : 3/5."
1,PROS1. Hukka was good nd hd good flavoursCONS1. Place need a huge order nd renovation.2. They don't clean up ( found a used tissue on table )3. Food is average ( 3 out of 10 )4. Not worth for the price.

4.5,My favourite place. Hookah and food both are extremely awesome. Even the prices are affordable. The combo's are really good. The service is excellent. Hookah is damn worth. One of the best places to hang out with friends. ?
3,"Undoubtedly worth visiting Hideout Cafe once with your friends. Ambience is more like a pub than a cafe with low-light. As there is no proper ventilation , you would feel a bit uncomfortable and suffocated inside the place. Hookah is good , food and beverages are a bit affordable and tasty as well. The crews are friendly"
5,The location is secluded but cozy..the food is really good and worth the price ...there is billiards and many other things to click pictures... The staff is kind and courteous...place worth a visit for ppl whi wanna spend quality time and good food :)
4,"Stumbled upon this on Zomato while checking for home delivery options. Yummy pizza- ordered a corn veggie delight pizza. Crust was good, golden brown and had generous toppings. Certainly will order again?"
5,best pizza i have ever had best place and delecious food eveyone must vist this place best pizza ? there are many varieties in ovenstory the best part is that everything is fresh
5,"I recently ordered from Ovenstory . Ovenstory offers you delicious and lip smacking pizza and sides , they are quite different with crunchy base .I ordered-?chicken overloaded pizza - its was heavenly, delicious . It had topping of cheese , chicken keema & chicken salami .?4.5/5?🥪garlic bread - it was crunchy and had corn on it , it tasted yummy.?4/5?"
5,Amazing pizza with super soft crust and loaded with alot of chicken. The variety of oven story is amazing with every kind of pizzas and sides it is one stop for all pizza lover's. Chicken garlic bread is my personal favourite. A new place for my every day hangout with friends which will not make a hole in my pocket too.
5,"Ovenstory PizzaSo new pizza place in the town people and it just doesn't give pizzas but a lot more.So I went there and ordered:? Middle Eastern Supreme Pizza? Garlic Bread with Mac and CheeseI just loved the package presentation, very well done.The pizza was really cheesy, with such a soft and crunchy base(just what I like) and the toppings were really good too with roasted falafel, corn and a lot of other veggies.The garlic bread was okayishh but mac and cheese was delicious sooooo cheesy and creamy.Their service was great as well.Overall-5/5Taste-5/5"
5,"While in the city at a visit, I thought of trying pizza from this outlet. I ordered a paneer picante pizza and garlic bread along with choco lava cake and brownie. The pizza was amazing in taste. The garlic bread was okayish. Desserts were too good. The delivery was warm and fresh and received on time. Quite satisfactory services!"
4,Located near BMS college of engineering.Food quantity is good for the price!You must try the leefu chicken and chilli garlic noodles!The chicken lollipop is also good.Small place but service and home delivery through zomato is good.
4,"We got home delivery from here on a Sunday night. It's good Chinese food and not very heavy on the pocket as well. The chicken soup was good, so was the chicken wings.Liked it. :)"
4,Its a good option for affordable indo Chinese cuisine in the neighborhood of Banashankari. Food seems a little spicy and oily. Will definitely satisfy your cravinga for some Chinese food.
5,The staff in Szechuan Dragon is extremely friendly and well trained. The ambience is great. A must visit place with friends and family. The food is served in a reasonable amount of time and is great.
1,"One more place with wrong over rating stars.... Not worth saying anything the food was so bad and didn't tastes anything, it was like just some stuff which you can eat... Surprisingly the dish was their chef's special..... Lol seriously how do these people get their food licenses...."
5,"Well what can I say about this place, it's one of the best Chinese restaurants I have ever been to. We reached here during the closing hours of lunch. First we had the Manchow soup which blew my mind. It was followed by the shredded chicken which was also mesmerising. They we had the mixed Fu Yong which didn't live up to my expectations. Then we headed on to the main course of Singapore noodles accompanied by roast chilli chicken. Everything was unbelievably good. Definitely going back"
4,"Dont go by the looks and location of the place.. you may be suprised by the no. of parcels going out and people at the place. The food will definitely fulfill your ravenous chinese appetite. The whole menu has a lot of wonderful food.. try the lollipop, hunan prawns or chicken, Dimsum chicken.Staff is polite and service is fast. The handwash facility is something to improve. Enjoy!"
4,This is just a jump from my house.Today bought manchow soup and spring roll it was nice.Noodles was good. It was packed well. Next time will have at the resturant itself for better taste.
3,"To be honest I have had better Chinese than this, it's not a bad restaurant it's just mediocre it's not the best or something getting excited over. We ordered some Pepper lemon coriander soup, i expected it to be little tangy and spicy as the name suggests but it was not that great. Leafu planner and Dragon mushrooms were not bad as well. Dragon chicken seems to be good. We ordered pulpy orange for a drink it was okay. Prices are reasonable and quantity is okay. As I said earlier it's not a bad restaurant but it's not something I would I'd die for."
4,Heard that this place is listed in top 100 must visit places in bangloreSo decided to visit it and it did not disappoint usThe place was small with around 12-15 tablesWe have orderedVeg wonton soup - 4.5/5Leefy baby corn -5/5Dragon chicken - 4.5/5Butter garlic rice - 4/5Pulpy grape juice - 3/5Dragons liar - 4/5Dragons liar is an ice cream and it presented along with fried noodlesKind of weird combination but tasted good
4,"This a simple laid back restaurant with minimal ambience, pretty famous among college students as the prices are reasonable. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs also one of those place where people visit only with word of mouth, as it doesnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât have eye-popping sign boards or anything!Have been here quite a few times, the food is good and itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs not very greasy like most Chinese places.Got general TsoÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs mushrooms, Kung pao babycorn and honey chilli potatoes, all were good.Main course was leefu fried rice, schezwan fried rice and veg ball manchurian sauce, all were sumptuousSo if u r looking for a quick fix dinner and nothing very fancy, this is the place"
3,Food - 8/10Service - 7/10Ambience - 7/10Cost - 8/10Very good place to have variety of Chinese food with variety of sauces. Food tastes good but they can improve a bit. Their service is fast but for home deliverys they are very slow. Ambience is fine with low light and soft music. Usually crowded in dinner time.
3,Dragon chicken has no cashew in it and Thai fried rice I couldn't find any difference from the normal fried rice.Packaging & food quality was good
4,I had the opportunity to try the desserts and I was very intrigued! I tasted the desserts and my favourite has to be the cheesecake ! Would definitely recommend the desserts for the quality and taste.
4,Had been here for dinner with family. Turned out to be a good choose suitable for all ages of people. Can try this place. We liked the most was their starters. Service is good. Prices are affordable. Will recommend this restaurant for early dinner. The place is little noisy.
3,"The ambience is really nice, staff is courteous. The price is pretty high for the quantity, but overall the experience was fine. The quality of food is nice but nothing extraordinary. They also have buffet(only veg)"
3,"I felt good is little expensive for the quantity they serve and In terms of taste is decent. There is nothing much to talk about the ambience, regular casual dining restaurant where you can take your family for dinner or lunch. If they improve on that quantity or may be reduce the price a bit or may be improve the presentation of the food it might Manage to get more repeat customers."
4,I was looking for a quite place to spend some time with family and as well wanted to try some new place. Since I was at Banashankari I thought of trying this place. The place had good rating and was part of Zomato gold. So I decided to try this place. It was a delite to see a very friendly staff and food we ordered was very tasty as well.Food : 4/5Ambience :3/5Friendly staff : 4/5Pocket friendly : 4/5Will definitely visit again ??
4,"Nice place to dine and has a good ambiance... Food is good and the serving time is also good..neat restrooms and we'll arranged tables....only thing is we went at 12.30 for lunch...and we noticed that they kept on playing one music back to back which was a little annoying...1. Chicken biriyani was so good and the chicken was fresh and tender ,rice was well cooked and overall was great2. Mutton biriyani was very very good and tasty and It had plenty of mutton pieces..."
5,"This place just cool ? with good ambience and slow music and having delicious food is where you find peace. Staff very friendly and they have maintained the place so clean. The price is average for what the quantity of food they serve.Thom yum Thai soup was best and was treat to mouth, roti was soft with that vilaythi paneer was perfect to have for veggie foodies, in rice we tried burnt garlic fried rice with vegetables and it was the perfect thing to end."
4,Quiet a good family type of place.. too calm and usually we don't find crowd here.. panner curry and the deserts is what we had tasted.. they wer really good but we found it a little expensive
2,"I had a very bad experience here.I don't know about a la carte, but the buffet was the worst. They gave us complementary drink and momos before the buffet. The momos were really good.The number of varieties first of all was very disappointing. The service was very slow. They refilled the food very slowly. The starters were okay. The main course also was so so. There was two gravies with roti and some rice with raitha. They had chats, sev puri and pan puri, which was average. But the desert was disappointing. They had gulab Jamun and chocolate cake. The jamun was not cooked inside. There was a cold blob of raw dough inside. The chocolate cake also was really hard and not that good.Overall the buffet was a bad experience for me."
4,Food: 8/10Ambience:8/10Staff:8/10One of the good places to try north Indian food...but depends on ur taste buds. Not everyone will like all the items here. Specially when u r particular abt sweet and spicy food.There's buffet available too.We had ordered paneer uttar dakshin and paneer kurchan..was amazing. The Gobi hara pyaz and mix veg were average.
3,A decent place for a family lunch or dinner.. well arranged in a simple manner. Food was tasty and the crew was very helpful and understanding..
4,"Great place to have a heavy lunch. Good service.The chicken biryani was undoubtedly one of the best I've had. Biriyani and Lassi would be the suggested combo. Buffet is the talk of the place, so try according to your appetite. A nice place."
4,Its the one restaurant near katriguppe that i found was really good. Good variety of Chinese and thai dishes. Service is good and good place to hangout with family as its a peaceful place where noise is really less and good view.
2,"Spice elephant soup SPL: almost manchow flavour soup.. Just above medium spicyLasooni fish tikka was awesomeI don't remember the dessert name but I have attached the photo .. It had vanilla ice inside wafers... Wafer was hell hard, egg smell chewy ... Nightmare dessert !Table leg space was very bad... I was so uncomfortable, the whole time kept on adjusting my legsNo parkingFor the taste felt this is too costly"
4,Zomato gold partner at this price. It was insane. They have really nice food. small place with very courteous staff and very cheap food for this ambience. Cost of soups is 80-100. Starters from 150-250. Main course 200-300. Cost for two was 800 for us.
4,A beautiful place to dine in.The interiors take you back to the Mughal era. The lightings are just perfect.We went there on the occasion of Christmas and so they had only limited items available. But the taste and service was not compromised at all.The only complaint is that the breads could have been better.Would surely like to come here again.
4,"I was here for dinner with my family on a weekday. The restaurant was completely empty. Ambience is good with some good old hindi music. Seating arrangement are good too. We ordered masala papad, panner and baby corn starters, lemon and corrionder soup, butter roti, olive and chilli paratha. Food was fresh and good, service is good too. Good for family hangout.Cheers"
2,Its a restaurant near to Banashankari BDA. Me along with few of my office friends visited to have buffet but unfortunately they only provide veg buffet. On inquiring they said this place is mostly visited by vegetarians. Anyways we ordered ala carte items which took ages to come. Food was ok ok. Definitely not visiting anymore.
4,We went here on a weekend and one of us had the buffet while two of us took Ala Carte. Firstly the ambience and service of this place is great! The buffet had a lot of items and the good was good. We had a Pumpkin Halwa intm the dessert which was amazing. Must try! The kulchas are great here. Cheers!
5,The best thing about the place is itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs ambiance. Second best thing was yummy ? food. We try buffet and buffet food was not disappointed us.Test ?. ?? ?? ?? ?? ??Quality ?. ??????????.Service: Staff was very professional and friendly.Overall experience was excellent.subirmajumder85.wixsite.com
5,Great food and pleasant ambience. Expensive but Coll place to chill and relax......Service is really very very good and friendly staff...Food : 5/5Service : 5/5Ambience :5/5Overall :5/5
4,"Good ambience with tasty food.Cheese chilli paratha with Bhutta palak methi curry is a good combo.Lemon Chicken in the starters is a must try item.Egg fried rice was also quite tasty.In the mocktails, recommend ""Alice in Junoon"". Do not miss it."
4,You canÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât go wrong with Jalsa. Never been a fan of their buffet and thus always order alacarteÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ. Service at times can be on the slower side but food is worth the wait.
5,Overdelighted by the service and food provided at this place. A royal and ethnic atmosphere builds a strong essence of being in India and also the quality and taste of food is truly authentic. I would totally recommend to visit this place once.
4,The place is nice and comfortable. Food wise all jalea outlets maintain a good standard. The soya chaap was a standout dish. Clearly one of trademark dish as per me and a must try.The only concern is the parking. It very congested and limited to just 5cars. The basement parking is very steep and makes it cumbersome
4,"So, went here with friends for tea. The ambience is striking to say the least. The posters from tea gardens and a wide variety of tea stories in transparent bottles along with their description on the menu makes them all so tempting to try. They have a umpteen varieties of teas from basic chai and lemon tea to variants like saffron and cranberry. You name it, they have it. They also have some food to go with it. But since I went there post lunch couldn't try. A quiet place on the main road. Perfect to hang out after work with friends or even family. A good alternative to the mundane coffee shops which have been asking the same variant of coffees for years now. Go give this place a try, you won't regret it.My ratingAmbience: 5/5Value for money:4/5"
4,Redberrys will provideswonderful ice cream flavours and some tasty delights to fill up your tummy with the italian touch friendly staff's quick response towards the customer food in redberrys were good and tasty we loved the pizzas that they serve nice place to hangout with friends one of the best place to jump in
4,"ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a place for having Gelato, not Ice creams!!! They have quite good variety of fresh gelatos. They are known for gelatos, although they have started serving Burgers, Pizza, Pasta now, Pastries & cakes. But I prefer this place for gelato, they are made fresh, very tasty and prices are nominal. The location of the cafe is on the busy DVG Road, some of the gelato flavorÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs which I liked are Bramhins coffee, Belgian Chocolate, Oreo Blast, French Vanilla and Bubble gum. The pricing of their geltos are priced very economically and offer value for money. I didnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât try other offerings, so I wonÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât be able to comment on the same :-). They also take orders for cakes and pastries. The place is neatly maintained, hygienic has seating arrangements for 15-20 people. Decent ambience,  One can visit this place and enjoy their Italian Gelatos"
5,1) pizza. shake and salad very nice2) location of red Barry's very nice3) staff good4) over all redberrys very nice places.. cool & simple places to enjoy evening with group of friends nice
5,"I stopped by this place when I saw the board on it's door saying they have a buy one get one free offer. When I went in, the place seemed ok, not a big cafe, just a small shop with some seating arrangement and air-conditioning.Food: I ordered a paneer and bell pepper pizza, Joe's burger, a Alfredo penne pasta and a farmhouse pizza. EVERY SINGLE DISH WAS AMAZING. They were fully fresh, extremely authentic taste and super budget friendly!! I also ordered a chocolate cake with Snickers ice cream. That was brilliant too.I'm Definitely come here again. If you guys are on a tight budget and want to eat amazing food, do come here!"
4,Happy to see such a cafe nearby to our house. It's not in bsk actually. It's very much diagnolly opposite to nu hospital (kidney foundation) at Padmanabhanagar. This cafe is run by a couple and their family. They're really very polite and friendly. The prices are very reasonable and I recommend this place for people who like to spend time with their friends... I had coffee which is amazing. I had cheese Maggie and masala fries which were well presented and prepared as well. Content of the food is very sufficient and I request the management not reduce the quality and quantity of the food. And not to increase the prices as well. I wish them all the best and request them to maintain the taste of the food as it is....
1,We read quite reviews of the place and hence chose to spend a Saturday evening here. This is a house converted into a cafe . It is in a nascent stage . The service is very poor and the taste is not worth the wait. We waited for 20 minutes for our Maggi!!! Service needs to improve!
4,Great food and proper Karnataka style full meals. Been there twice and was fully satisfied.. Will give 5 stars if it's well managed............
2,Reached the place at 3pm on Saturday. Half of the items on the menu were over. What was annoying was is the food was cold. The taste was also very average. Only dosa and holige were good. There were very few people in the restaurant and the service was still very slow. The waiters were all standing in one corner and talking. Had to call them repeatedly.
4,"Had been here, good food served and tasty,good place to go with freinds and family, should be first to get served well with all food. One of the good hotel there for this price."
2,"How can a Udupi restaurant be so dirty.the floor the walls the waiters are all stained in food.Why cant they clean it? The floor even had decorative colour paper every where and lot of food.Now coming to the taste of the food- it was pretty decent for what they chargw.What upset us was the menu says they serve thambuli, two variety of rice etc but they were all over at 2.45 but they still charged us full amount.Lastly if u r ok to b seated with random people and adjust with their table manners( burrping etc) then tis place is decent for a quick veg udupi meals"
4,Aadhuri Udupi bhojana is one of the best vegetarian hotel in and around Banashankari localitywere we can enjoy the authentic south Karnataka style food.
5,One of the best restaurants for unlimited food. Price for one full unlimited meal is ?150 and the service is awesome here. If youÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâre a costalian you will love the food served here.
4,"Been here a couple of times. Highly satisfying on both the ocassions. Great food. Decent service. At price of 160 per person it is of a great value. The staff here serves in a traditional Mysore style dresses. The food is authentic Karnataka meals. I really liked the pineapple pickle/chutney. They serve some 4 varities of rice of which you shouldn't try all as you would already be full. Roti, Dosa were decent. In the deserts, Payasam& Holige were good.I think it is one the must try places to try some authentic south food even if you have been to the likes of Kamath etc. this one is a little different. :)"
5,Very good restorent good south Indian food very nice all food s are good we spent good time and food in this hotel value of money we loved it
3.5,I went to this restaurant on Sunday afternoon.It was a bit crowded.Its located in the 1st floor Above anna kuteera kathriguppeYou need to take food coupon in the ground floor itself.it was 160 rs.Taste wise it was good.Service was slow.Nothing exciting/different in the menu.Whatever they serve its good.Worth for money.
5,"Awesome place , worth with price , quality , quantity , service , hygiene and discipline I loved it ???? wish there were more rating stars to give I give 100 on 5 for sure"
3.5,"Nice food, good ambiance, so many verity of food, this time i was in hurry so, next review will be detailed one. Its good to see all dishes at one place"
1.5,The food was not satisfactory. Not one item served could be eaten again . Only advantage is the price but even that is not going to be enough to make me visit the place again . Dear Udupi staff people wouldnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât mind if the food quality was better for a higher price and please get more fans so that people wonÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât have to deal with another disappointment of sweating while eating.
5,"Excellent quality and taste, more variety of authentic south Indian food. Excellent service. Highly recommended. Worth the money we pay here."
2,"I'm rating 2 only because of the large number of items they serve for the price they charge. While the taste is moderate, the biggest turn off is the poor service and totally unresponsive staff. They are either understaffed or poorly trained. I didn't get to taste a few items, thanks to their ever busy staff, and ended eating what was served. Please learn the crowd management from other peers like maiyya and roti ghar"
5,"One of my colleagues suggested this place. Went there at 1 pm and place wasnt crowded. Ambience is decent and cool. A welcome drink ""appekai saru"" was served. Then started..typical ""baale yele uta"" . Diffrerent types of palya, kosambari and sides. Then came masala dosa, pulka,pulav, veg rice bath. Masala dosa was very very tasty. Service is bit fast as people will be coming, but they will make it slow if u tell them to. Then comes rice with sambar,rasam, daal,tambali. And yes, dont forget to eat holige,payasam and icecream. Service is very nice. One best thing is all of this comes in just 160 rs and its unlimited!!! What else you want!! A must visit place for south indian foodie!"
3,Been here last week with high expectations based on few reviews. But utterly disappointed with the food quality & taste. I feel it's an overhyped place! There are many better places in the vicinity for Plantain leaf meal. There was too much of waiting & these staffs were too hurry in serving food & asking people to finish meal & leave quickly. I can understand there is a waiting and staffs should approach in a positive way. I will never go there again!bangaloreepicure.com
4,"I have a confession, being a south Indian I distaste south Indian food(not that I hate it, I don't like it either).But still made up my mind on Sankaranti to have authentic south Indian food visited ""Adduri Udupi Bhojana"" because it was close to my place.I just had a look at the menu told myself that I can do it(I am not blessed with a tremendous appetite).welcomed with the mango soup followed by the wide variety of dishes served, I have developed the new love for Pongal(both sweet and Khara).I can still feel the taste of the ghee bursting in my mouth but it was""kai holige"" that made my day, crisp and soft.not to forget food is served on a banana leaf that adds in more flavor and taste.waiters are attentive and responsive.The customer's needs are monitored and addressed.so much variety for just 160Rs without compromising on quantity and quality and yes it is unlimited.This visit turned out to be a surprise package."
3.5,Food is good.No parkingAmbience is averageOverall its value for money if you looking for south Indian food.Preferred the tiffin items......
4,Had been on a week night for an authentic south Indian food. I personally love being served on banyan leaf. The waiters are all dressed up in traditional Mysore attire wearing with a peta. The food was delicious and definitely worth it's price. The waiters are friendly and serve u well with a smile. The food is prepared without garlic which is a plus point attracting many senior customers.
3.5,"Food is good and enjoyed. With 150 Rs. is very nice.Note: (It happen with us) - If you going TWO people, you may need to share the table there. Its almost crowed. - You have to sit where they ask, you can't choose even if all the table are empty. Just wait, eat and come back."
5,Excellent Ambience with delicious meals with 10-15 variety types. Worth paying for money and you can dine out if you are with more friends/relatives in home.
4.5,Very good and Unlimited . especially masala dosa . Service and ambience was also good. will visit again with friends . very very reasonble and wholesome food
3.5,"Aaaa wt to tell, Unlimited food, food was like exactly like south indian marriage food, 2 soups, sides masala dosa, all were unlimited for just ?150, except ice cream in the end ?? they give a water bottle, and main thing is have patience to get place to sit..... ??,there is no parking place of this outlet, and difficult to park in front of the restaurants,"
4,"Food - 4/5Ambience - 3.5/5Service - 3/5Easily the best cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå© in the neighborhood and possibly the only one not including the CCD's that you find at the end of every road.Appears to be a popular place for smokers to chill at, as the smoking area looks very quaint and comfortable.I would recommend their pancakes with chocolate syrup and ice cream which I've enjoyed everytime I've been there."
4,"The Coffee Shack is one of the lesser known, but cozy places in BSK 3rd Stage. It's located just a few hundred meters from PESIT on Outer Ring Road.? Standout Features of The Coffee Shack:??Nice ambience??Not too crowded??Good pricingThe food is quite good and service is very good. Since it's not too crowded, this is a good place to catch up with friends for a long conversation.I've been here on multiple occasions and haven't been disappointed any time. Some dishes need to - of course improve, for example the Nachos which are served with cheesy sauce all over - making it completely soggy.Star Factor:Ambience: ????Service: ????1/2Food: ???1/2Quality: ???1/2Presentation: ????"
2,"Though the presentation of the place and food looked good, nothing that i ordered tasted good here. For starters, though the name says Coffee Shack, there is hardly any coffee options. The masala tea was machine brewed, the hot chocolate tasted like watery bournvita milk amd the garlic bread was very salty.The management has to put in extra efforts to deliver good food."
4,"Cozy place with good varieties. Been for a weekend brunch. Thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes. Masala Maggie, scrambled eggs, pasta all were up to the mark. Quite highly priced though."
5,"The food was amazing, the chicken barbecue literally gave me a foodgasm, the nachos were also good, the chicken and spaghetti was yummy.The desserts might need a little bit more attention especially their choco fantasy brownie(it was a bit overpriced) but otherwise it was a memorable experience."
4,"I had read good reviews about this place, so we decided to try it out yesterday.My order-1. JalapeÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå±o cheese balls-Yummmyyyyy. And good quantity for 2 people too.Very good cheese filling on the inside and crispyness on the outside.A must-try starter.2. Veg Alfredo Pasta-The sauce smelled incredible, and the pasta tasted even better. Everything was cooked to perfection, with right amount of cheese and vegetables.My favorite dish of my order.3. Virgin Mojito-Refreshing drink.4. Smokey Chicken Burger-It tasted good, but not great. The patty couldÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâve had little less meat. IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâd rate it 7/10.Overall, the place had ample seating area, and courteous staff.I had a great time here, and IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâd recommend it to all. ??"
3,"Cozy and comfy place located in hoskerehalli near banashankari 2nd stage. Easily identifiable as it is located in the busy main road.Food:1)veg paneer pizza which is of thin crust. Tasted very dry and wasn't hot.2)twistato was tasteful. Where two pieces are served in a plate with tomato and mayo sauce.3)virgin mojito was refreshing in the end.Service:Was quiet quick and staff people were friendly.Ambience: Outdoor seating available with plants around you. But it seemed to be like a smoking zone.When you enter inside,it's quiet spacious with many seatings and books around you with all photos on the walls related to food.There is one more section if you go inside,where screening is available."
4,"It's one of the few good Cafe's in Banshakari.If you wanna just chill and play some board game with your friends,this is literally your go to place?The food is amazing too(savoury crepes are must try)Coming to the ambience,it has really good interiors and very very calm place to study too!The staff is very friendly and the service is good"
4,"Nice place for coffee and just chilling out with friends. The price is justified for the quantity and quality of food. We tried Caramel latte, naughty choco jar and nutella banana shake."
4,"Visited this place on a Friday evening...very relaxing ambience for both smokers and non-smokers with various board games. Had ordered corn cheese balls, garlic bread ,green apple juice ,spinach corn savory crepes, french ratatouille with rice. All the food delivered were hot and yummy. You can take one corner in restaurant and enjoy food with uno..ludo ..chess .. snake ladder. Overall a weekend well started ."
4,"A cosy walk in into a enjoyable time with amazing food. It's on the main road and is not difficult to spot.They don't delay in serving except for first 10 minutes then u get food all at a shot (uncool, Caz we asked them to serve our later) but we forgot everything once our buds touched the feast.The really cheesy fries, Aribiatta pasta, and the sandwich, were AAmazingg. The food here is not disappointing, n you find good variety.Not over priced either, since it's a new opening.They have a separate area for smoking, normal dining and an air conditioned room, choice is yours.Peaceful for business talks or studies.Food - 4.5/5Ambience - 4/5Price - 4.5/5Service - 3.5/5Recommended for any meal, peaceful and in budget food."
4,Easy to locateVFM 3.5/5Taste 5/5Yummy cheesyyy fries ?Delicious pastaThey're a must try ??Loaded nachos and green fries are average!!
4,"A tuck shop in Banashankari, slightly off the crowded Banashankari bda complex. The menu is interesting....and I had no complaints on the food as well. While there is no wow factor in the dishes or the ingredients.... for sure no disappointment when tasted too. Since it is in the concept of fast food, they served in foil box.... unfortunately along with plastic spoon. May be they need to immediately change to a wooden spoon. We tried loaded fries and white sauce pasta...both were good. Will be a good adda for college kids."
5,"Been here multiple times. First visited a year back. Their cheesy loaded nachos were really good. Their waffles, although takes a lot of time to make, do taste quite yummy. Even their white sauce pasta is nice. And the prices are definitely worth the taste. Service is pretty good too. Love visiting this place!"
5,"Being in banashankari, this has to be one of your must visit joints.Remember being in college and having all my gossip sessions here.Resonably priced, friendly on the pocket this is the local hangout spot.Coming to the food they have amazing varieties of fries, nachos and pasta.The owner and the staff is really sweet too and ice creams are amazing?Must try their bubble tea!"
4,Our always go to place when in and around Banashankari. I have been visiting this place since the past 2.5 to 3 yrs. Over the period of time the quantity and quality has a slight dip. The management is as friendly as always but i suggest them to revisit on the quality of the food. Else it is a nice place to go to for a quick snack grab when hungry.
4,"Yummy saucy fries!! Loved every bit of it , and worth the price , al the items on the menu were cheap and the quantity wasnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât bad.. loved their mix of sauces ?And I also tried ordering from this shop online , and they reached on time and was packed very well, I ordered mixed cream pasta it was really good."
4,Value for money everything they offer is amazing. The fries are especially delicious and make for the perfect snack. Been here a lot and tried almost everything they have to offer definitely worth it.
3,"It's a busy eatery in Banashankari, and draws the young in droves. I tried the green fries and the spicy fries and liked the quality & quantity."
3,Ambience is not that good enough and it's not a pocket friendly cafe and the quantity is not that good and desserts are too good enough ??..
3,"RATED Went there for a quick bite with friends.The ambience had more of corporate feel. I would say it was unique.Tried nachos, pasta churros and lasagne.Nachos were pathetic.( Seriously don't order)Pasta was okayish.Lasagne was good.Nutella churros were the best.Overall an okayish experience!Peace ??"
4,"First of all, a big thanks to the staff of this Cafe. Very polite and courteous.I was there 15mins before their closing time. Without any discomfort or hesitation, the staff welcomed me with a warm smile and said they're still open, though they were preparing to close the cafe for the day.Quickly ordered the Thai green curry, which is served with rice. They got it for me within 10mins, hot and freshly made.It was tasty with the taste of coconut milk. Not very spicy, it was mild spicy.I saw they had yummy looking dessert menu, should go there to try them out!A good spacious place to hang out for coffee, pastas, pizza or Thai food."
3,A place for people who love churos. Otherwise it's a normal simple cafe like any other in town . Can go and spend the evening there . The positive being it is one of the better cafes in and around Banashankari and also the place is not very crowded .
3,Have been visiting this place since years. The quality has gone down drastically. Food quality has become very average from good. Service is also very bad of late.
1,Really disappointed with the place.Seems like a old dusty store room stacked up with old sofas and chairs! The decor is soo disappointing that I cannot put it in words!Lastly the food was cherry on the cake to make it a complete worse meal.This place is the last option you should ever consider.
3,Congested atmosphere due to smoke from kitchenAmbience was kService was k .Churos was a new experience recommendedNear to kims . Parking was not der
1,"Cockroaches !! I Repeat cockroaches!!Bakasura was disappointed.Being in Banashankari, being a gold outlet and nesting them? who can even think of that. Thankfully it wasn't over bakasura's plate. The ambience was last cleaned a decade back i guess. A cockroach just walked over our table. As it was alive, and well moving , the bakasura couldnt take a pic of it. Then the staff had to actually take it out of our table. Such ambience ? like what are you upto?Bakasura disapproves. I dont even want to talk about the food."
4,"A nice place to hangout, this place looks professional and also cute. If anyone is trying churros for the first the time, this is the place to go. Cheesecake is pretty amazing too.Recommended."
4,1) pizza mocktails shakes and churros really very good2) staff good3) ambience simple and nice good4) location of San churro cafe very nice5) over San churro cafe good....
3,"One of my favourite places that I often visit in South bangalore , but quality has been reduced than before. Little unhappy with the food this time.But their churros never dissapointed me. Staff are too slow and do not respond easily.Soups:Minestrone soup was like vegetable stock water with vegetables in it, not happy with it.Churros :It was great as usual. A must visit place if u love churros.Starters:1. Africano panner -It was bit sweet and not happy with the dish!!2. Loaded nachos -This happened to be their one of the best dishes, but now I take back my words. Very dissapointed with the dish.Main course:sicilia pizzaPizza was too good, it's a must try dish.Finally I would recommend this place for churros and pizza .Taste : 6/10Ambience :7/10Value for money : 8/10Overall experience : 7.5/10"
4,"Visited this place long before, place come to.notice with the decoration lights outside the cafe. We ordered churos, pizza and hot chocolate, all were good just I little priced more."
4,"Spain pictures of Churros triggered Nostalgia about it , which led to Google search for Churro places in city , lucky we to get the result as San Churro cafe , we had an delectable churros here along with hot chocolate and Nachos ! Thanks for fulfilling our thirst of Spanish Churros !Food : ???Churros ???Hot Chocolate ?Nachos ??Service : ??Ambiance : ?Cleanliness : ??One drawback : Store had some flies, I hope they take care of them for our next tour ?"

4,"Though very sadly the place looks in need of retouching, but the food was great! Especially when it was super cold outside and we were super hungry, the staff was nice. We ordered the pink pasta and a pizza. Both of them were pretty good. Was really tempted to try their Churros but we were stuffed. Worth a visit and try for sure!"
3,"Churros, the restaurant's eponymous offering, has to be tried. They're a Mexican snack and served with chocolate sauce. Milkshakes are good too. The interior walls have murals and writings all over. Haven't tried the pizzas here but the cakes and pastries were pretty good."
3,"Honestly, have only tried parcels and that too only starters and mains - never tried desserts. So this review is based on starters and mains only. The quality wasn't all that great, was pretty average."
4,"Visited this place for the first time, recently. The ambience was pretty good. We ordered two 'churros for two'. Having churros for the first time ever, I was way too excited and judgmental. But swear to Lord, the churros were heavenly! The chocolate sauce was the actual chocolate sauce and not nutella xD We had taken the Cross Country Ranch pizza. It was a thin crust pizza loaded with veggies.The place is famous for churros (the name suggests so). I would love to visit again to try all the other items out :')"
4,"I love the desserts more than anything here !Good place and well served !:)We dint like the nachos here , it was not that good as we expected !Except nachos almost all dish were quite good!"
2,"2nd time I have visited this place and I am surprised to see how it has declined. Churros was hard, pizza was pathetic, loaded nachos and masala Garlic bread were topped with cheese with MAYO! Yes mayonnese.. Soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state, mocktails were average and our only Savior was pasta and caramel pudding... This place has high potential but let down by dull ambience, pretty slow and inattentive staff. Buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499, We still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed!! Most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower. I did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other. That'll be my last visit San Churros."
2,"Not so good place as I was expecting from here. The ambience is quite ok but the food is not good at all and very slow service. There were only two people in the outlet to serve the customers, not satisfied upto the mark."
4,"I love this little house. Easily located in the Uma Maheshwari temple main road. It's a quaint, pleasant cafe where u can spend the evenings in the company of good books.we were attending a meeting nearby and my partner recommended to have a cup of coffee here. While Looking at the cafe from outside itself got impressed with there ambience, with white picket fence & with few outdoor seating. Awesome decor, lovely indoor ambience with AC and comfortable cushion seating with board games in the big shelf with 100 more books to readWe settled in their swing chair seating with the view of outside and ordered for filter coffee, french fries, brownie with ice creamMust try filter coffee is perfect for south Indians strong and with a good quantityPeri-peri french fries were so tastyFinally, a dessert came with good quantity, the brownie was good ... Overall I loved the ambience and the food#Ambiance -- 4.5/5#food -- 4.5/5#service. -- 4/5#parking. -- yes#occupancy -- 60-70 folks"
5,"This Cafe located just near Banshankari is a great option to hangout when ur bored of the innumerable CCD s in Jaynagar. We ve been here a couple of times, last time we took our nieces to celebrate one of their bday here. It was empty so we kinda had d whole place to ourselves. They have a section with swings to sit in, kind of our favorite part of the cafe. There's also a section with small bean bags, a place where a group of 5-6 people can sit, play games and have a good time. We chose to sit here with our nieces, played a few board games. My nieces enjoyed it.Coming to food, we orderedPotato Wedges - 5/5Corn n Cheese Garlic Bread - 5/5KitKat Milkshake- 3/5 (quantity didn't match d price)Belgian Waffle with Icecream - 4/5Red Velvet Cupcake -4/5Would surely recommend this cafe. Staff is friendly. Can park ur two wheelers right in front of d cafe"
2,"This is a tiny cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå© located just opposite Kathriguppe Water Tank. The interiors are quite nice, and they serve a mix of Indian and American snacks. The food isn't too good, neither are the beverages. I've tried the Strawberry Milk Shake, as well as Iced Tea and they have been nothing but flavored sugar syrups mixed with milk/water. My pick of beverages here is the Chikmagalur Filter Coffee, which is priced at ?15. This cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå© is not really vintage, but not terrible either."
1,Worst place not at al worth for money don't ever visit for 140rs u get a small pizza which is totally yuk ?and service is also too poor waste of money and time don't visit
2,A really tiny place and nothing vintage about it. The food has hardly any quantity when it came to the veg cheese corn sandwich. There were literally just 5 french fries with the paneer burger. Ordered a pizza which was not good. It felt like eating just cheese and no hardly any vegetables in it. Not great service as well. They don't have chilli flakes and oregano.K. That's all.
3,"Very cuteee place,suchha kutty place but very decorative ,peaceful too,u can pay n play ludo n all there is a book ssection n no good books so they can improve on that coffee is good but sandwich was bad cheese was no baked can improve on food"
2,"This is a hookah cafe. It was not mentioned anywhere in the page that it was a hookah place. There's also no separate seating for non smokers. Horrible ambience. Ppl including waiters smoking hookah everywhere. I'm never gonna visit this place again. Also, I found an eyelash in the hot chocolate shake. The hot and cold chocolate are below average."
4,"Loved the ambience and the interior, very colourful and lively.The seating is spacuous!The food tasted really goodThe chicken was eavenly cooked and was softWe ordered lemon chicken dragon chicken and jalapeno poppersThe poppers were oily but otherwise it was good!Great musicNice sheesha!One disadvantage , the sheesha is only for one hour on the weekends ... We'd like to obviously sit for more time!Otherwise everything is great.Staff can be a little more well learnt or greetable"
4,"It's actually a hookah cafe with awesome ambience and good food and a bit slow service , I ordered chicken burger which wasn't very good but the barbecue chicken wings were awesome Its a great place for hanging out with your friends."
3.5,"Visited this place on a weekday and only 2 or 3 tables were filled. This place is located in the same building of sapphire toys in the main road of kamakya road.Ordered KitKat shake, ide to milkshake, onion rings and chilly chicken. Everything was pretty decent.Chilly chicken was spicy and tasty. Onion rings could have been done more well. Both the milkshake was above average. Sheesha is the main attraction.Ambience is decent. They've used an old scooter and made it look attractive. Service is prompt and good."
4,"A hookah lounge!Bakasura makes it a point to mention such info before every review. As some are particular in such ambience.It's bakasura Recommended!!The food bakasura ordered were fries, nachos, pizza, blueberry Oreo and virgin mojito!When it comes to food. Every single thing was good. The nachos was crazily special. The blueberry Oreo milkshake is something that bakasura Recommends. Pizza was thick crust and very well stuffed.Coming to the ambience. It's rooftop and it's crazily colourful. The yellow chairs and the Christmas tree that was put up. Everything is perfect.Staff needs a slight improvement.Overall it's greatFollow Bakasura for more such reviews.#BakasuraForever"
1,"For the price we pay here worst food I have tasted , steaks are bit ok but not that good. I love pasta to the core but red sauce pasta had lots and lots of basil in it and taste was also not gud .I wouldn't recommend this place."
3,"Ambience: This cafe is located in banashankari 2nd stage near kamakya theatre. This is basically a cafe on the rooftop which is very busy all the time. The place has nostalgia feels because old scooters are present inside which attracts everyone. Has small LED lights, lamps, dream catchers and plants around which looks cute during evening.Food : 1) BBQ veg pizza was very big and was good. But wasn't yummy as expected.2) Arrabiata pasta,This is a must try. Was really tasty and yummy and creamy.3) Jalapeno cheese balls was very cheesy and hot hot served with mayo.4) Oreo milkshake was okay okay.Service: was really bad."
5,"Great hangout spot to spend long time over conversations with friends with delicious food.Must try: cheese toasts, babycorn pepper dry#rajeshwrites"
3,Good place to hang out with friends. Food wise nothing great. Not advisable to go with family. Even if it's roof and sometimes it's suffocating
4,"First thing first, do book a table if you're going here on a weekend. We had to wait for about 20 minutes.Talking about the service, I think it has to get slightly better. 3/5Though people prefer this place for sheesha, I'd been there just to grab a few snacks. The cafe frappe and mushroom pepper were great! No complains. 4.5/5Ambience: 3/5 I wish to go there again, some time during the week."
2,Before cafe eleven was good enough with the food stuffs and all but now staff has been changed and it is not a pocket friendly cafe too and service is too poor ? hookahs are good enough but food taste is up to the mark ? ambience is good enough ??
3,"It's a decent rooftop with pretty funky ambience like scooters, colourful seats and green pots on it. Food tastes good! I didn't liked brownie fraape and our order took a lot of time too, just look towards that once. It's pretty good place for hookah lovers. Reasonable price too! Overall one time visit is ok."
1.5,"This place was good to hangout when it was new. Now it has nothing to it more than a bunch of regulars smoking their lungs out and some noisy college students playing pool.Beware of the roaches here.Conclusion is, bad coffee, no ambiance, too noisy and mostly nothing to eat."
3.5,"Probably this is the only cafe which hardly has customers. I've visited this particular outlet about 3-4 times and everytime not more than 2-3 tables are ever occupied.Have tried their coffee, corn spinach sandwich and mango smoothie.Kappa is not very expensive as compared to it's competitors.Service was good. However, they had burnt our sandwich. But replaced it immediately without any argument."
5,"Coffee, Nachos, Greenwave Sandwich, Paneer Sandwich are some of all time favorites. Basket of fries is amazing. No hassle parking available. Nice courteous staff."
3,"Not a huge fan of the ambience. Esp, when it's sunny n the dry wind kills you at noon, this is the last place on earth I wanna sit n dine . Been here a couple of times. Very courteous n attentive staff though. Quick service as well. Love their Chicken Tikka sandwich. They have a good range of quick bites as well, esp the potato wedges being a favorite. Plus used to like their Lasagna pretty much, with all that spicy, juicy meat stuffed in."
3,"I never used to like this branch of Cuppa. The tea they serve tastes weird. Their donuts are extremely hard and etc.But after they have started off with hookah, I've started frequenting it. The hookah you get here is one of the best in South Bangalore.It'd be a better place if their snack ons are paid more attention to, by the chefs."
3,"Ordered cold coffee and sandwich and espresso . Sandwich was average ,espresso and cold coffee were good.Ambiance 3.5/5Food quality 3/5Service 3.5/5Overall 3 / 5"

5,Food is good. Paisawasool food
1,Its tooo cheap quality its road side food is more better
5,Dal methi and dal fry along with tandoori roti too good
3,While the biryani here was more than good for a post midnight delivery service and it had a couple of above average chicken curries that I have tasted the chili garlic fried rice wasn't exactly a good dish (overflavoured?). Overall a good place after 12 but can improve in a lot of areas.
2,Fast but taste not upto the mark. Try improving the taste and quantity everything else is ok. Hope the next order wouldn't be bland and similar in taste
1,Absolutely not satisfied. The order was too late and I did not expect this from zomato and it affects my trust with zomato
1,"Worst food quality. The platter was so bad that the boiled egg was the best of the worst. Prawns were 2-3 cms long, fried in oil. Chicken which tastes like rubber. Same with fish and mutton. Biryani is decent and sweet."
4,Order was delivered a bit late. But considering the time and the taste of food the late delivery (by 10 mins) is negligible!
3,order is different from what I placed
2,"Well , I tried this place for midnight delivery . They did provide me the food but their chutney was just curd and colour .How can they even deliver this kind of food . I could taste the colour in the chutney . Never ordering again ."
1,I dint receive the order at all
1,Pathetic chicken chilly
4,"Food is not excellent but it is good enough and is the only restaurant that delivers in kengeri after 12. Don't expect greatness, just expect something to satisfy your hunger"
3,"I feel the packaging charges are bit more, the food was not much hot and The strawberry ice cream was melted when delivered.. i felt bit disappointed with the order."
1,"late delivery, bad taste, not worth, it has become cold by the time food got delivered"
3,DidnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât get the gravy mentioned on the menu. But food otherwise great.
4,good but can improve
2,Took an hour more to deliver.
1,food is not at all hot it's full chilled
4.5,Good and best taste food midnight best delivery service .....................................................................................
1,Such a third rated restaurant and they made me to wait 1 hour for food delivery and later they say items not available and made me starve.i cursed them ..don't ever order food with this restaurant.
1,not good food
5,I didn't receive ice cream... I did payment how to refund my amount
4,burger was nice today
1,Had ordered cheese balls and chilli cheese sandwich. They ended up delivering veg nuggets and veg sandwich which was not at all hot. Veg nuggets were over roasted and sandwich was so blank.
1,Sell coke at MRP please.

5,Good service amazing food is super tast .............................................................................................................

5,Amazing
1,"Most disappointing wrap IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâve ever had. It sucked to the core. I had ordered Paneer Tikka Wrap, the wrap was too bland without any sauce/chutney/spread in it, it had only a few pieces of hard Paneer which was put into it with a few slices of onion and nothing else. The paneer seemed to me like rubber, one would actually need strong teeth to take a bite of it. The flatbread of the wrap was burnt and was too oily. It was quite thick as well, didnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât seem like a wrap. Overall I would have given negative points to the wrap, but canÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât really do that here.Save money for the morning and have something worth spending rather than having food from here.Worst wrap IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâve ever had.DO NOT ORDER WRAPS FROM HERE.DonÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât know how bad/good are other things from here but wraps from here are definitely a cross."
5,Delicious food
5,Amazing Tasty and Healthy food
5,good service biriyani is full tast night food delivery........... best restaurant............................................................
1,"I have ordered chicken chettinad curry full, surprisingly i got only 5 piece and I tried to call restaurant,but the phone is switched off. Worst service by restaurant and zomato should not be tied up with such restaurants."
5,This restaurant food is good and delivery boys are very fast to delivered very good taste and very nice quality is fine and super restaurant

5,Good food and test and fast delivery and test supper kqntity supper and trebles is clinens.................... hotel ...............................................
1,"RATED Horrible. Not even kidding. We ordered BBQ chicken wings and chef's special pizza. They gave undercooked chicken wings and the sauce on it was not even BBQ sauce. It was some local sauce with little spices in it. Pizza hardly had toppings on it. Staffs were so irresponsible. We had to tell them to give us the plates and cups after waiting for so long time . Also food delivery is so late. You order it now, you get it literally half an hour late."
4,"While this place is more common for hookah, most of the food menu is good as well. We tried the JalapeÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå±o cheese balls, Veg Lasagne, chicken tikka pizza, fish fingers. The pizza and lasagne were good, other dishes were pretty average. It's a pocket friendly place with nice ambience and loud music. The service is good too. Overall, nice place for hanging out with friends."
4,Ordered in from the cafe so can't say much about the ambience.. the food however was good. Loved the chicken lasagna which was spicy and flavourful. Had also ordered fish fingers but found those only okay. It lacked the fishy flavor and tasted like normal fried chicken fingers. Will probably visit here soon to be able to give a better detailed review. Would give it a 3.5 but the restaurant gets the benefit of a 4 because of the 5 point scale..
5,This place is nice...i love the Ambience...the manager is a sweet person...he saw to it that we were well treated...we ordered hookah with ice base and the manager gave their special flavour which was good...we then ordered mushroom Manchurian which was amazing... ntg could match the taste of it...the crowd was also great... I would surely go to this place again..Ambience-5/5Hookah-5/5Service-5/5Food-5/5
4,It's a new place hence the interiors are not that interesting but still a good place to hangout !! The food is a lil costly but then tastes good..
4,"This place is located in the prime area of Banashankari just opp to BDA complex on the 3rd floor . The place is good and the ambiance looks very nice..place was started recently and the menu seems to be very defined and really good . I tried few starters in baby corn and my friends tried few in non vegetarian . What I liked the most is the milkshakes , which was really thick and snicker milkshake especially was really good . I loved it..one must try it here..the presentation was really good..the only thing is as they serve hookah , they do not open the ventilators and sometimes it will be suffocated . But other than that , food , beverages everything is really good . Must try..Please do watch our videos on our YouTube channel Tummy On Fire , like , share and subscribe .Please do follow our page Tummy On Fire on Facebook , Instagram and Twitter .Thank you"
5,"Visited this cafe with a bunch of friends on an evening.The place is located next to the Banashankari BDA Complex and is easily locatable.It has an amazing ambiance and very well ventilated tables.The view opens up to the BDA complex with the trees allowing the cool breeze to flow into the cafe area. With some of the best tracks playing in the background.The food was excellent being served at very reasonable prices. The place Also serves hookah, The hookahs are very nice with the staff being very courteous to the customers making sure they are comfortable. Overall a great place to hang out with your buddies."
4,1) food very nice2) staff very good3) ambience simple and nice4) location of restaurant very nice5) service little bit slow6) over all very good restaurant and good taste
3,"A decent ambiance, tried ghee roast squids, ghee roast chicken, chicken kebab and lemon chicken, which wasn't that great. They should serve food little faster."
5,"This place was on my wish list from long and i went with my friends and enjoyed delicious seafood and chicken ghee roast out of all that we ordered i like pomfret rechado masala and chicken gheeroast all my friends were appreciating the food quality and the ambiance was very beautiful, well maintained"
5,Good place to enjoy with families and friend with delicious coastal areas foods along with Goa food. I really enjoyed their fresh sea food with delicious taste.Ambience: 5/5Service: 3/5Taste: 5/5Rate: 4/5
1,WTF this is the quality of your food see the below image.found screw in gravy.dont buy food from this restaurant such irresponsible people.bloody they will kill people by their irresponsibility by preparing food like without seeing.shame on u.
1,Very worst food and less quantity I got.....Most worst experience I got from Chinese kitchen .....And jusce is also bad in order I didn't like the this food veg roll but it doesn't look like veg roll
1,"Worst Worst Worst food order in my life...its been more than one hour am waiting but still they are not yet delivered my food,not able contact them also and not even they contact me to inform that there is delay in deliver.There is no way to track our order in zomato.Worst ever experience am having today.I have paid for food but am getting angry only nothing else yet.???"
4,it was great. Thank you
1,Found stone in Rice
1,the fingers ordered was half baked
2,Very nice food. But quantity is very very less. If you book offer food in zomoto always get less quantity. May be tied up with restaurant for offer food. So rating 2 star.
1,Food was very tasty when I ordered it for 1st time but when I repeated the same order food was not tasty at all.. It seemed like they have given old one. The delivery was quick but food was not all to the expectations.
5,Food is really tasty. Everything is at affordable price. I don't know why they're not delivering rolls any more online bcoz they're really damn tasty. It'd be really great to add them on the list again
5,Like Chinese? How about an added combo? With north indian cuisine too!! A perfect hangout for your taste buds with your friends and family!!!
1,"Very good experience placed online order after accepting by restaurant next within 20mins they cancelled my order without any valid reason, contacted to support team said in simple way sorry for the inconvenience and will get refund within 7days. And it late night staving couldn't find any good veg restaurants."
5,Awesome for the amount paid! Really satisfied
5,The food here is very delicious and cheap too. But that doesn't mean that the quality is bad. Roti curry will cost you 25 bucks and it's worth more than the price. Chinese meal combo will cost you 75 bucks and it's totally worth it. The taste is also very good. Overall I would give this a rating of 4.7.. Why? Coz they're providing delicious and great quantity food at a very low price without any compromise in the quality. Even the soups here was gr8 for the price.!! Totally loved it
4,"Excellent food I had a spicy corn soup and sholey ke paneer. The soup was average, but the paneer was excellent. Great service. Excellent ambience."
4,"Good place for a vegetarian food lovers, good service by the staff and the dishes were also quite ok in taste and appearance. Overall nice experience coming here."
5,Our go to place when ever we are looking for comfort food. Food wise it has been awesome since years. The quality of the food has been consistent since many years of my visit. One of the best vegetarian restaurant in this locality.
4,"They are perfect in preparation of vegetarian dishes, when we talk about North Indian food, this is something which you cannot find in other restaurants.I have been to their Jayanagar outlet many times so I planned for dinner here this time. I already a fan of 1947 for vegetarian dishes. So this time I have tried Panner Tikka Dum Biriyani and Panner Lababdar gravy but this time I didnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât liked Biriyani because itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs not actually a dum Biriyani, taste like a regular Biriyani, So IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâm cutting a rating for that apart from that everything was fine. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs been a while and itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a late review. About the ambiance, which is very desi Indian styled restaurant and all the staffs are very active in serving food dishes.So I will recommend this outlet to all veg food lovers."
4,"One of the best places for north India food lovers, it being a veg only place makes it a great option while going with family.Lot of options to choose from.Service is very quick even though itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs always bustling with people, the menu has improved a lot from when it was started.Have been many times , so not naming any dishes, except for a few dishes all are well made and tastes good."
4,"Service and ambience is good, food is decent( neither too good nor too bad)Their buffet is better than a la carte. Zomato mentions opening time as 7pm, but they start giving seats by 7:30"
4,"Very good bakery, good quality pastries. Pastries are so soft and fresh and moist. I love pineapple pastry and chocolate pastry here. Cookies are okay."
4,"Cupcakes so pretty and appealing. They tasted less like cupcakes and more like pastries. But the taste was delicious. So, no complaints. Had the dark chocolate truffle and not to forget how pretty it looked. Also, had the pineapple cupcake. :) I've also had the other pastries and savoury stuff here and they're pretty good. The chocolate mousse cup and the mushroom puffs are my favourite. Not to forget the humble black forest. I can vouch that they make one of the best and juciest black forest cakes. I've been having them since 2010 and I've never been disappointed with it. Do give it a try!"
1,their cake was not fresh at all its base was so watery that we can squeeze the water from it not at all satisfied after paying so much for the cake
1,Even after repeatedly asking fresh they said today morning prepared. Birthday spoiled. Even counter was empty they said preparing items. Its not the case. No quality no customer.
1,"This place is just beside Mane Thindi while heading towards Kamakya theatre. If there was some reaction or emoticon bigger than dislike or angry face I would have given that to this place. It's the WORST PLACE EVER. I have my justification for it too. You buy cakes for special moments but what happens if you discover hair ..yes, you read it right HAIR in your cake.. and you begin puking out of disgust. One of my special days turned into a disaster courtesy this place. Wouldn't ever suggest it to anyone.Besides this, the cakes are extremely sugary and watery the bread and puffs are average.Huge thumbs down from my side.Do you have something less than one to rate them Zomato??"
1,"I purchased wheat bread on 15-Apr which is manufactured on 15-Apr and expiry on 18-Apr. It is cake of the day, Ring road, BSK 3rd stage. Please see the photo of this bread. Very concerned about food quality and safety."
2.5,Toooooomuch sugar water on cakes and very hard biscuits only liked the colour and combinations decorated in cakes. The rating only for friendly service.
3.5,"We went on a rainy evening to hog some snacks. We tried Choco Almond pastry, Almond cake, Assorted Puff and an eggless orange cake. Cakes were too sweet. Puff was oily. Tastes were good."
4,"Best Cakes around the region of banashankari. I like their Eggless cakes very much.Their menu of pastry's are pretty random but good to taste.Try out normal honey cakes here, tastes really good.Bakery items such puffs, buns and chips are little overly priced is what i feel.They have good customer service and faster delivery. They do not have any seating arrangement or any ambience as its almost located next to main road.Would definitely recommend for Cakes!"
3.5,"I used to be  frequent visitor to this Cake Shop, until a new, better one came up within walking distance from my place.This particular branch is almost almost always crowded, and there is hardly any parking space around here. A bummer, according to me. Anyway, the quality of their cakes is pretty good! Their Black forest, chocolate Mousse, Chocolate truffle, and Pineapple pasty are my favourites! AMong the non-cake stuff, Spring roll puff and hot chat puff are worthy mentions.The prices are fair enough. Do give it a try!Food - 4/5Ambiance - 2.5/5Service - 3.5/5Value for money - 4/5Hygiene - 3.5/5Overall - 3.5/5"
1,"Never ever tasted a worst cake than this.....!!Not even bad its worst...............................................................,............"
3.5,"Cake of the day, the one  on ring road is swarming with people. I am so amused. They have good number of eggless varieties and sometimes you find some unheard of flavours. But this place is expensive, specially when there are others like Just Bake, Daily Bread who offer more elaborate decorations for the same price."
4,"If you are a sweet tooth and you have a craving to eat cake.. (And you are a student of some college in that area ;)) , this is the place to be.The cakes are sumptuous and juicy. Not at all dry... Being a chocolate lover, I can boldly suggest that even the fruit flavors are amazing.The savory items like the buns ,puffs and mini pizzas are super good.My favorite cake is the mango cake . <3"
3.5,"I have been a frequent visitor to this place since it is quite near to my home and the college where I studied. The place is neat, hygienic, the cakes are quite good. And are priced quite economically compared to other cake outlets. The salt biscuits are worth a special mention, they are delicious! And if you want a birthday cake,they usually have 3/4 cakes kept ready or you can get it custom made before hand too. The cakes are affordable and light on the pocket, definitely worth getting your birthday cakes from here."
5,"Mane Thindi & Cake shop seems to  belong to the same owner as they have the same bags & packing etc.  I would avoid the cake shop but the south indian snacks at tiffin center mane thindi next doors are really good. He serves Dosas, Idli, Vada, Shira, chappatis & other stuff which lots of people come to have. Most importantly the snacks are priced quite right here and don't seem like most other tiffin centers in Bangalore where they want  to make tons of profit these days. Coffee is pretty good too. Give it a try sometime, I don't think you will be disappointed."
4.5,Most of the flavors of  cakes are quite mouth watering. This is one of the best places I've found in Bangalore for Cakes. Of course their puffs (specifically the paneer puff) and other bakery items are quite tasty. Its a place not to be missed incase you love cakes.
3.5,Simple n clean.....good taste ...
4,I tried all kind of pastries. Each and every pastry have unique taste and value for money.
4.5,"One of the best pastry shops among its range in south Bangalore.Every time you reach the shop, you will be surprised to see a new variety of special cake available to meet your taste buds with yummy cakes."
3.5,"Situated in the main ring road,., beside mane thindi,.. katriggupe.. this is a decent bakery outlet..I haven't taken any cakes home so far but I have tried the veg puff, palya bun ,salt biscuits, vanilla pastry and some butter biscuits.. They are neat and decent ,Fresh most important !These bakeries are no less than your Butter sponge and VB and saves the efforts to travel until those famous bakeriesIf you are in the mood for some bread toasts,buns,pastries,biscuits, rolls... u can surely take some time to visit this place"
4,BEST SHAWARMA EVER!the shawarma plate here is totally worth the money.(mayonnaise is amazing)Chicken grill is nice and spicy!Their biryani rice is also worth the money.Easy on the pocket also :)
5,We had grilled chicken here. The quantity is worth the price that you pay. Best and fresh quality chicken served. If you are in town and want to have good non-vegetarian food and care less about the place to sit then this place is a must visit?
4,One of the nicest places for non vegetarian food around Jayanagar. The barbeque tandoor chicken was really nice and spicy. The broast chicken was really crispy and delicious. They add some extra masala on the top of the chicken to give it a spicy taste. The Mayo served with barbeque chicken is the perfect thing to compliment the spicy barbeque chicken. You need to have them hot once they are served as they usually they tend to dry once it becomes cold. Overall a great experience !
4,"This outlet is close to my office and the other outlet in Rt Nagar is close to my residence. Both the outlets have provided some mouth watering tasty dishes,the stand out among them are the shawarma roll n plate. Biryani combo is also great. Overall it is a place where you get to eat to the fullest and it provides justice to the money spent."
4,Giving 4 stars just for their shawarma which has been my fav since the 90s. Along with the chicken shawarma ordered a parotta with half grilled chicken. The grill chicken was a lil dry - not impressed
4,"Located near Lalbagh west gate, the place is a hidden jewel. It's spacious, stuff is courteous and best part is their cuisine. Oh the quality of kebab is just mind-blowing. We had tandoor & grilled chicken. Those were served with mayonnaise bowls. Both of them tasted delicious. We also ordered grape juice, which had grapes floating in it. The price is also very reasonable. I wonder how a place like this is in a costly city like Bengaluru.My only request is bring this franchise to Kolkata. You won't regret, as Bengalis are the connoisseur of good food."
4,I ordered the biryani from here. It was good in the taste and quantity was in more and quality was also good. The biryani was good and the price was also less. If you are hungry at night by 11 pm or 11:30 pm you can order quickly. Biryani was the bestseller of them. Thank you!
1,Worst experience.. no courtesy to even call and tell they cannot deliver.. after one hour through Zomato chat I am told itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs still being prepared after me asking them.. y do u accept orders in the first place when u canÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât deliver.. this is one place I would never ever want to look at for dining or delivery..
3,The delivery was quick and the food was fine. The size of the rolls should be reworked on as they are extremely small. The Gobi Manchurian should be made a bit less spicy for people like me.
3.5,The place is good. The food is tasty. The grapes juice is the best part of it. Don't forget to try it for once atleast. Overall the place is average.
3,Dish :1. Barbeque chickenTaste : 2/52. Tandoori chickenTaste : 4/53. Rose milk ( Must try)Taste : 5/5Place : Kabab Magic ( RV road Basavanagudi)Ambience : 3.5 / 5Service : 4/5Value for money : 3. 5/5I ve been visited the place for a couple of times as of now.... I mainly go to have their rose milk... It is one of the best i must say.... Barbeque chicken was one of the worst i ve tried their... Tandoori chicken tasted really good with right amount of spices n was served with green mint chutney.... Ambience was good but nothing great... Service was quick n good too.... N i also feel it is worth the money for the quantity .. You can visit this place if you love muslim style cuisine ...? ?
4,Quite a cosy & small joint but defi someplace to look out for... All variants are amazing n piping hot & delicious . Quite a buzzing place in d heart of locality
2,"After a long thought decided to head to this place to try out their food. Decided to have avalakki n I think one of the decisions i made which will make me regret for a long time. It was dry n without the chutney it just wouldn't go down well. Not that chutneys were great. Overall it was below average. Not the one to be let down n disappointed, tried their kharabath. If not for kharabath my rating of this place would be a point lesser than what I've rated now. Not that the taste of kharabath was out of the world. But it certainly was better. Only thing I didn't like in kharabath was that it was too oily. Not a good one from health stand point. Nevertheless not that I have it everyday. Will you regret if you miss having food in this place????? U certainly wouldn't. Trust me, you will find much better places which will not make u regret."
3,"Had been to Brahmins for a Sunday breakfast. A small shop that you can easily miss if not for the small crowd outside waiting for their turn. No seating and very little space inside even to stand. It opens very early at around 6 in the morning.But nobody really cares as the melt in the mouth thatte idlis more than make up for it. Soft, silky and buttery , it goes perfectly with the tangy chutneys, tomato and the regular coconut. We also tried the podi butter Idli which is thatte Idli smeared with butter and gunpowder. The podi was different in taste than what IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâve had earlier, with a distinct tanginess to it. The udad vada though was average.Tea and coffee were routine and good.All in all a decent place for a quick breakfast.parkstreet19.wordpress.com"
4,An ideal breakfast spot in jayanagar. One of the best thatte idly I have had. The taste is good as always. But they need to improve on the service. Green chutney was out of stock. Over all a good place.
5,"A perfect restaurant to have the best of thatte idle specially in and around jayanagar. The soft and spongy idle served with butter makes it one of the ideal and must have breakfast spot.Must try: pudi butter idle, khara bath and vade#rajeshwrites"
5,Has a really calm roof top.Staff delegate customers with kindness and are really attentive .Menu holds a lot in place with wide variety of cuisine.Good for groups of upto 4Not family friendly.Beer on a hot day tastes good with complementing dishes.Easy get away place for KIMS students.Overall 4dot5 stars
5,one of the best place to hangout.. I oftenly hangout with my friends here... They serve beer and mocktails... The variety of steaks and egg based pizzas is amazing and the rooftop ambience is crazy... On a chilled night you ever want to have beer do visit this place ?
3,"The photos on Zomato and reviews mislead! Nothing great about the place. A decayed roof top, below average food and lazy service. I see a lot of student groups probably very regular here and the staff is very friendly with them. Congested, crowded and a bit unhygienic."
3,"This place has great food, good place to hang out with friends. It is situated right opposite to KIMS. They have a rooftop as well as indoor seating. I especially loved the gustoes legendary pizza here. The nachos are great too, with superb toppings. The veggie pizza and the penne Alfredo pasta could have been better. The mocktails were just about average"
5,"Had been here with friends after celebrating ethnic day in college! It was kinda we don't care what other's think when we are with friends attitude. Since all of us were looking like bride and groom. The food here was great, especially the grilled fish steak! Being a fish luvr i really enjoyed it. Being the only person whi doesn't booze in group had settled for watermelon fizzy Mocktail and it was gud. The roof top Ambience here is beautiful!"
3,Food : 2/5 || Ambience : 3/5 || Value for money : 3/5 || Service : 3/5Menu is so big and they have not perfected in any one of them except for fries. Food is acceptable and not really appetizing. Smoking and non smoking area is not seperated.The only good things about this place is beer and french fries. That's the max you can go.Recommendations : Average
3.5,"Location:Right opposite KIMS college in Banashankari.Ambience:The place has a local vibe and is filled with the localites. Not a very comforting place for women to hang about. But the food is worth it.Food:Ordered-Kung Pao ChickenMurgh Beer House TikkaPanneer Sofiyan TikkaWell cooked and flavoured chicken. The King Pao Chicken was my favourite. The peanuts added a nice touch to the chicken making it crispy and soft all at once.Usually, once you eat chicken, panneer never can never meet your expectations. However, a special mention for the paneer Tikka. The panneer was soft and definitely mouth watering. Easily a good plate to remember.Murgh Beer House Tikka was no different than any starter. Though the name stands out, the dish had no flavour or taste that stood out and made us wonder about the ingredients. But, it was tasty alneit. So, no qualms about the food here."
4,"Good place to chill out with small group of friends, not very trendy i felt. Yes i went at night tho. Well friendly staff. Food 7/10, Ambience 7/10, Service 8.5/10. Well it was slow drizzled for a wile and they dint allow me to sit in the roof top so they are carrying also lol."
3,"Have visited this place multiple times over the years.They have newly added Budweiser and St Martin craft beer to their menu. Used to only serve Kingfisher earlier.The menu is good. The pizzas are very good.They have couple of salads which are very good. Raw Mango and Papaya salad is excellent here.They seemed to have increased all there prices recently. The prices now seem a bit steep.Overall a decent place, without much competition in its locality.Worth visiting if you stay close by."
4,Descent placeDescent foodPathetic serviceLive sports screening is availableService as far concerned was the the worst part they should actually look into
1,Wanted to try cupcakes But could not reach this place. Call not reachable and maps is wrong. Please provide correct contact and address information....
5,"Amazing flavors and taste. Absolutely love the cupcakes that she makes!! Her chocolate ganache cake is to die for. Super flavors and exciting desserts, I was very happy with the cakes and cupcakes!"
5,The chocolate vanilla cake for the new born prince was just awesome n amazing with really nice flavour !! Really great in taste and great enjoy the cake !! We are glad we made it awesome n great !!! Nice n happy to be with sugar rush keep the good work going !!!! Thanks again for delicious cake
5,Yum cupcakes and amazing cakes which are beautifully designed as per the theme. Never disappointed with sugar rush. She has the capability to do any kind of bakery stuff.
4.5,This is one place where I always order because of her finishing and the taste.Nutella and chocolate being the best.Recommend others to order from her.?
5,"Home baker who promises fresh food !Understands customers needs of customisation ,And the quality of the final product is just amazing !The best part of it is that it's ALL EGGLESSFood , flavor , finish - all awesome !"
5,"Ordering cakes, cupcakes or any kind of customisation of bakery product has always been brilliant. What matters is the taste, which is very good. A good blend of all the ingredients. The finishing on fondant cakes are exceptional. Her attitude towards experimental baking is creative & thoughtful. The products used are high level and it's worth all your money. ?"
5,One of the best eggless bakers in town. Amazing finish to customised cakes. Cake loafs are a must try and nutella and double chocolate her best flavours.
5,This is the one stop shop for all your sweet cravings!From tiny cup cakes to three tired wedding cakes she's conquered it all! I call her the queen of chocolate tempering! Highly recommended! :)
5,An amazing Baker who bakes good quality cakes and varieties. She is just super in making any kind of cakes with amazing texture and finishing. The best part about her cakes is that is home made and maintains cleanliness and use all fresh items.
5,"The most yummy deserts I've ever had ! Be it a simple vanilla cake or a beautifully designed@ fondant cake, the baker has always given the best to me. Highly recommended ?"
3,Burger King is a well know place for varieties of burgers and also we can find varieties of beverages and ice-creams..Taste : 3.5 / 5 .Price : 3 / 5 .Ambiance : 4 / 5.
2,I ordered chicken whopper and large fries which came damaged with small fries only. Very disappointed with the service of Burger King and Zomato. I never expected such service from neither of the two.I don't know why brands are spoiling there name now a days.
4,The bowl itself is of qood quality ingredients.Well packed and delivered on time.Had the panner tikka bowl and the channa.Both the curry were good and itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs served with a good portion of basmati rice.The rice is topped with jewelled veggies and olives and tastes good.Missed the raita and felt the rice was a bit dry.Would rate it 3.5 but since there is no 0.5 marking it 4.Please see if you can some raita or pack the gravy separately.
3,"The Good Bowl was gracious enough to offer me to take part in their review program.Packaging - The packaging was good and the bowls were delivered when the food was piping hot.Taste - I had ordered for a Paneer Masala Bowl and Makai Masala Bowl.The rice used in both the bowls were same. Simple flavoured jeera rice with some ghee topped with seasoning of oregano powder,olives and some colorful capsicum. It blended really well with the curries. Paneer Masala Bowl - The curry was well flavoured, rightly spiced with great amount of paneer.Makai Masala Bowl - The curry was tangy and slightly on the sweeter side. People like me who prefer less spicy food and are in love with corn can go for this bowl. The ones who like spicy food would probably be disappointed with this one."
5,"I was searching for a new restaurant which serves a fusion of Indian and Western food.The Good Bowl promised me a simple mix of flavours and unique ingredients all in a SINGLE BOWL!I ordered a Mac n Cheese Bowl along with Mughlai Chicken Rice Bowl with Omelette to taste both the Veg and Non Veg varieties.The box was packaged well and arrived hot. The Veg Bowl with cottage Cheese was an instant hit with my team.The Omelette, and the well cooked rice was a per fact mix. Extra points for Black Olives and Jalapenos which are my personal favourite!If you want an executive meal and non messy meal with a mix of Proteins, Carbs and Fibres."
5,I ordered veg mac and cheese. Loved it .good taste and quantity. Package also good ..would like to visit the outlet and definitely I recommend my all frnd
5,Ordered veg Mac and Cheese.loved it.good taste and quantity.packaging also good..would like to visit the outlet..and definately recommend ...
5,People who are always on the hunt for biryanis with perfect spice balances must give a compulsory visit to the biryani cafe near Avalahalli BDA Park.Any spice can be felt best only if with marination and any dish which come to the table here undergoes a 4 hour marination process.The unique combination of spices makes this place very unique.Must try: Paneer fry and mint cooler#rajeshwrites
4,"I have been here once and I tried chicken Basmati biryani the taste was good close to Hyderabadi Biryani but the gravy was not good, ambiance is ok."
5,A hidden gem serving the best Donne Biryani in town. I should say this has been the best Donne Biryani I have had till date. In fact IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâm tempted to go back and give a low rating to some of the other Donne Biryani restaurants.The Biryani Cafe Chicken Fry is an excellent starter and a very unique dish. Crispy and hard on the outside and gets soft and juicy as you bite in. Just the right amount of spicy and this starter goes well with the Pudina Juice.Donne Biryani is cooked to perfection; the rice is cooked just well and the chicken pieces are softer and juicy. A must have dish at this restaurant.The Dum Biryani was just on and I should say is not as tasty as the Donne Biryani.The ambience takes you to old Bangalore with one wall adorned with pictures of the city in the early 70ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs I guess. Service is great and enjoyable.
4,HavenÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât been to the restaurant but have ordered online many timesThe Biryani is Authentic Karnataka style with the right amount of flavour and spice served that a light onion raitha they also have different variety of biryani (Basmati)My favourite are jeer rice Biryani and The egg chilliDecent pricePocket friendlyCheers to the whole team ????????
4,"I went to this place in search of kothu poratta, but when we reached they were like they donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât have kothu poratta, I was really disappointed and my friend told the thing , and they prepared it for us , the staffs were really good and I was happy , it was really goood , and plus damn spicy, authentic kothu poratta??Loved every bit of it , never miss out on this"
3,"Highly recommended by a friend, this cafe is situated within the streets of banashankari. The ambience is pretty decent and has a rustic tinge of the past. The food was good. I had ordered paneer special fry. The paneer was fried and roasted in butter. The taste was unexpected and completely new to me. The buttery taste with a slight sour flavor was slightly weird and nice at the same time. I would recommend this place for chicken (which my friend had) and mushroom fry, which is supposed to be delicious here."
3,Had the urge to have rolls and upon googling found this place near to where I stay! Tried it out and I will go again!! I had tava panneer roll.. The best one that I've had till date. The best one!! The taste is divine and is superb!! It's an open kitchen and one can pretty much c what's happening in there. Hygenic for sure! Very nice. The service wasn't slow as such. I got it in less than 5-10 mins of ordering it. Lot of delivery guys were there. Online delivery is a big hit I guess.. Had Veg momos too.. Not the best one. Hence the rating 3.. Was surprised to see momos being heated up in an oven. Didn't taste like momos.. Was not great.. Can easily avoid!! Nevertheless my next visit will for sure be only for rolls!! Super ones!!
3,"Good place, nice food and snacks. Friendly people and good tasting food. The prices have increased so it's not quite worth the item anymore, but once to try it out, it's not bad.The momos and rolls here are really good, what I've liked; and so are the cheese fingers."
3,Food - 8/10Service - 6/10Ambience - 7/10Cost - 6/10A small joint of rolls on wheels which serves good rolls but quite overpriced for the quality they provide. It's a clean and hygienic place. Sometimes the staff is not co-operative.
4,My go-to benne dosa place!The paddu here is a must try.The chutney here is spicy and on point.Its best to take parcel from here.The benne dosa is very tasty and the girmit is also good.
4,"Wanna have davangere best Dosa this is the place we're u can enjoy mouth watering dishes.Must try dishes are1)Benne Masala Dosa2) Girmittu3)set Dosa4) Mirchi5)flitter coffeeEnjoy hot, Crispy Dosa with butter melting on top.yummyFollow me on insta fr more such reviews -@hotte_alli_motte."
4,Sri guru kottureshwara davangere benne dosa in basavanagudi is a famous dosa point for have special dosa with North Karnataka style.Food - We had the special benne Masala dosa and surely I would say it is a go for dosa since the aloo mash is not spicy at all and goes very well with the dosa and the chutney with the dosa becomes the best combination. The chutney is spicy and very tasty. Then we had the khali dosa which was again smeared with lots of butter and again with the chutney was very good.Food - 4/5Service - SelfPrice - 4/5Happy fooding.
5,"A small outlet of davangere benne dosa at basavangudi.All the dosa are too tasty and crispy. Best was the butter kali dosa.Paddu and avalakki are also available here.Its very crowded on weekends, need to taken for your token number, but its worth waiting to taste the amazing dosa they prepare.Highly recommended if you are in Basavanagudi.#foodie #dosalovers"
4,This is one of the famous places in Basavanagudi for butter dosa and I tried open dosa it awesome and it is one the best dosa ever eat and no place to sit.
3,Dosa is good...chutney is nice...palya doesnt have onion only potato. Taste is very good.liked benne khali and benne masala dosa.Pricing is ok. Good option for south indian breakfast.
3,"Located in Netkalappa circle, this place attracts good crowd during weekends! Have been to this place more then thrice. They offer benne dose,open dose,mandakki,avlakki,bajji, paddu and idly! Open dose,benne dose and paddu are highly recommend here. No proper place to sit and hotel is too small! However you have space infront of hotel to stand and have food. Rates are decent,starting from 35-50?. Authentic coconut chathni and mashed potatoes are highlights at this place!"
4,"Stopped here before shopping for Diwali crackers. The Benne Khali Dosa, Open Dosa, and Chilli Bhajji were pretty decent. I liked the taste of their Benne/Butter."
5,"Finger licking good.The DBD is obviously the star and is a must try. Crisp, slightly sweet and fermented. With the classic white aloo mash.The paddu and mirchi bajjy are good as well. Washed down with some good filter kaapi. Authentic, stand and eat place.Do be prepared for huge crowds, esp on weekends. But they have a reasonably efficient token system. So thankfully no pushing and shoving."
4,Ambiance - 3/5Service - 3/5Taste - 4.5/5Really tasty food. It's good to have for a change once in a while. The dosas and paddu are amazing. Decent place to hog really good food at a decent price.
1,very bad deliver boy who denied to come to deliver the item in the location given . I didn't expect this from zomato . we had to go somewhere else to collecr it and he misbehaved . highly dissatisfied.
4,"Situated near bull temple,dodda ganapathy temple and bugle rock park. A very simple eat out point. North Karnataka cuisine. Extremely economical.Tasty food.?"
3,"Firstly they should pack food properly and deliver in a paper bag or any relevant, which was missing. Food was not hot and chutney was insufficient/shortage. Quantity was of Benne dosa, Khali dosa and Paddu was very less. Specially Khali dosa size was very small and not sufficient for single person."
5,Authentic BENNE DOSE (butter dosa) served with some spicey coconut chutney on the side and some mashed potatoes. All for the price of 35 rupees.Served in a small hole in the wall joint right in the heart of old Bangalore - Basavanagudi.
1,"In the food i ordered (chicken lollypop) i smelt a bad smell like old rotten oil, please don't give customers old food we have families too."
1,"The food are worst here. I suggest everybody not to order food from here. Order food online at Zomato but not from here. This is the worst food which I have taken after coming here, at Bangalore."
3,Regularly visiting this place . It's nearby for me only . One thing I don't understand is so much rate difference in the food as you could notice in the menu itself .You could enjoy biriyani and kebab here . I didn't find any other dishes tastefull to me
5,"Great food and price is also good..only problem is ambience..great for home delivery..Chicken meals, chicken kabab and other dishes taste great..must visit!!!"
3,Good Paratha curry but a bit conjusted. Near to PES University so students can have nice food here. Less costly than others. Good place and hygienic. Lots of items on menu
5,Very tasty food. Chicken meals was very tasty.. just behind pes college busstop stop outer ring road. Inside u can see dr. Rajkumar sir photo. Naati style..
5,"Great food with mid-range prices. The taste of their food is great but the service was a bit slow. It is good for business meething, couples or family night out.?"
5,Very good restaurant and perfect burger....Sandwich and snacks and veg's Sandewich.........................................................
3.5,It is a place for BIG PORTION SIZE lovers. Yes! You read it. The burgers are huge. You may have a wrong impression to see the price on the menu. But when you see the burger that's when you realise it is worth it! I have tried most of the things on their menu and they stand true to their description. Amazing Iranian flavour makes you to go back to the place again and again.Don't go by he looks of the place. They really know what their customers love. And they take good care of it.
5,Tasty burgurs and nice french fries ???it is Persian style and non spicy foodsI suggest u to test kolbeh burgerIt's only place to have big and good burger in banashankari
5,"the best sandwiches and burgers you can get in bangalore , the most tasties and filling , incredibly delicious and extremely worth the price"
5,very big sandewich and burger I enjoy it?Burger is best...In Banashnakari only place have such big and delusion lamp burgerI suggest u to try once
2,"Hi,We had masala puri, sev puri and mix chats at this restaurant recently. I must say the taste of mix chat at around 8-10 yrs back was amazing and i would always request my parents to take me to this hotel and get me a mix chats because that was something unique at that time. But now the taste of all the chats were not at all good. It is a self service restaurant and the service was quick. There is also some place to sit and have your food. Parking shouldn't be a problem for a two wheeler."
4.5,"Upahar sagar is always a nice place to savour South Indian cuisines and a recommended one when you are nearby. They have got an open kitchen where you could see how are they preparing your food. The ambiance is quite okay. And apart from the south Indian cuisines they have got a other varied dishes and beverages.We had been there for a quick breakfast, and ordered for bisi bele bath and chow chow bath which turned out to be good. The service is quite fast when uncrowded."
4,"I'm a regular visitor to this place.It's my go to place for any fast grab meal.Their north Indian dishes are very tasty. Chats are also delicious.Their south Indian dishes, dosas are very crispy and tasty.I have literally tried everything on their menu.If you're in a hurry and ready to compromise on extremely good ambience for tasty food, pocket friendly this is the place to go to."
5,My all time instant visit place. The only place I've not got bored visiting though I go daily. And all the items here are so tastey yummy. One should not miss to visit to taste best flavors of each dish
4,This place is close to my office about 5 to 10 Min walk.I Have been here many times for lunch. And few times for breakfast. Masala dosa here is crispy and yummy.So this time i wanted to try something different during lunch.my friend suggested to try triple fried rice here and Luckily i saw triple fried rice on the Menu board and ordered it.It was yummy. It is combination of noodles and fried rice.However noodles will be thin and crispy. For every spoon you get crispy noodles which i liked it pretty much. They don't accept cards and little crowded during lunch time. It is Pocket friendly.recommended for casual breakfast and lunch.
4.5,This has been among one of the earliest eateries (initially known as the darshinis) in banashankari. Foodwise good and has been my go to place for breakfast and sometimes for lunch and dinner. Masala dosa is good and is crispy. Usually I take paneer tikka Masala and kulcha and is good as well.All in all a great place to have a quick eat and not heavy on the pocket as well.
1,"1)If you're looking to dine for a special occasion, this is not your place.2) It's self service system.3)Food is satisfactory ( I mean good, but not that good).4) Hotel staff not that great(Now the worst on Oct-17). Some of them just have a lot of attitude.5) Cons: Don't accept cash cards.6) Had a bad experience over here one time.I had asked for a Raitha because I ordered Veg Biryani, they had a very unpleasant attitude. At last they denied of giving me one, saying Raitha doesn't come with a Biryani here."
4,"I have been going to this place for like 5-6 days, actually I have started working nearby. So it's the only good food outlet in that area. I have tried many dishes basically puri (3 in no.) with South Indian chutney and cheese sandwich. I have tried rava dosa. Also orange juice and sweet lime soda. Food is really good and fairly priced. Basically you will find only corporate people around during lunch hours.Serve time is very fast. You have to take the bill first and food later. They have self service. Sitting facilities are properly provided. But during rush hours, people also stand outside near trees and tables kept.Overall good place."
4.5,"I stay very close to this restaurant.Whenever there is no cooked food at home,this will be at our top list for hotel food.Its has very good food with reasonable rates.Earlier many food items taste had to be improved wherein now,it is really doing good with food supply and quality.Its a self service jotel with ample seating facility.At noon,it will be so crowded as South and North Indian meals are available at very low cost with awesome quality.It Indeed fills anyone's stomach rather opting for a fine line restaurant.I love this place for Madila Dosa !!! And yes Dal fry tastes good here.Jeera rice too !!!! Many to pen down.An overall good place for foodies who stay nearby KR Road :)"
3,"As this is located very near to my office, we often used to go here for lunch or snacks.Place is ok when you don't have much options, Not so great food.Food: 3.0Ambiance: 3.0Service: Self service :)"
3,"This place used to serve amazing food earlier. However now the quality has come down a lil. Anyway, still worth visiting for a quick bite with a reasonable price."
3.5,Upahara Sagar is just down the road and the restaurant is perfect for Idli and vada. Especially the vada here is very crispy and handful. Their chutney is really authentic and so is sambar compared to other restaurants.  Other food in the menu is also good but nothing extra ordinary.
3,"A typical darshini style restaurant in KR road. The menu covers a variety of dishes and everything is just above average and not the best. Their Jeera rice is good , otherwise an average hotel. Can have once in a while..."
3,"Have not been here several times. Ordered a rava dosa once late evening, and it was pathetically oily. There was oil dripping from the dosa, and it did not taste or look like a rava dosa either. My friend who had some special stuffed dosa from the dosa counter in the front had a better experience."
4,"What do i say about this place?1. Its near by my office(0.5 km). Its more or less like a lunch out place for me.2. Its basically on the KR road, near the shastry bakery signal.Mind you, its heavily crowded place(especially during the lunch hours). The biryani, fried rice, gobi manchuri over here is good. The desserts there are quite yum. I love the north indian thali which gives you soup, cups of rice, curd rice, 3 curries, 2 rotis/kulchas, fruit salad, gulab jamun(one of the best), tomato soup for 90 bucks! and the taste doesn't disappoint you :)Comparatively small place, service is ok(you have to wait when the place is crowded and you dont get your orders on time), worth visiting 'n' number of times where 'n' is a very large number! :)Service: 3/5Food: 4.5/5Ambiance: 3.5/5"
3,One of the few darshini in the long stretch of KR road.....after Krishna grand this is the only other restaurant serving south Indian food ...in this stretch of the road......its an old restaurant with lot of management changes......the current management seems pretty decent......they are serving pretty good quality of food with some interesting combo offers too......prices are quite low .......there isn't much of an ambience ....its a self service restaurant.......if your looking for a darshini that is cheap and serves good quality of food in this KR road stretch u can definitely visit this place........
3,This hotel has been there since as long as I can remember.  I used to come here when I was a little kid. The management has changed since.This is a self service darshini type hotel with seating arrangements. The waiters serve the food to car parking space right in front of this hotel where people sit inside their cars and enjoy the food.I usually order Either North Indian or Indo-Chinese dishes from here. All the dishes here are above average and pocket friendly. Chats and jucies are pretty average and nothing exceptional. They have started 99 variety dose stall a few days ago. I will try them and update the review ASAP.
3.5,"Have been regular to this place from the time they started, This place is situated opposite to shastry's bakery, On KR Road..PARKING: Parking will not be a problem since they have space to accommodate few bikes and cars.AMBIENCE: This place is a single floor setup with stand and eat, with a few tables and chairs as well as car service option... Place is clean..FOOD: They provide south Indian, north Indian and Chinese dishes along with chats and juice. In particular south indian breakfast items, Rotis and curries are pretty good..Food is decent.. They have combos too..SERVICE & COST: Service is quick and dishes are reasonably priced.."
3.5,"Upahara Sagar is a decent South Indian restaurant in KR Road. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a typical Darshini style restaurant with ample varieties of south Indian dishes and some minimal north Indian dishes for lunch & dinner. I have been to this restaurant a couple of time for breakfast and lunch and impressed with the food quality and taste!During my visits taste was consistent with zero complaints and most of the dishes they serve in breakfast menu are quite decent without burning your pockets. There is no point of mentioning about particular dishes to try here, everything is virtuous. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a self-service restaurant with a couple of tables & chairs to sit and eat.There is nothing special about ambience here; it looks similar to other DarshiniÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs in Bangalore.If you are in KR road donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât think out for second thought, do visit this restaurant for breakfast!Overall:Quality: 3.5/5Taste: 3.5/5Ambiance: 3.5/5VFM: 4/5bangaloreepicure.com"
4,"Do you like?on your?spicy tandoori non-veg gravies? Then this is the place to order. Tongue searing spicy chicken tikka gravy satisfied my tongue but my tummy? I will know later ? Actually both me and my mom are to blame as we like to eat the gravy by itself...no rice roti ya ragi. Lots of green chilli roundels were the culprits but the gravy would have been ok with naan or fried rice. Anyway, we enjoyed waking up ? our tongues.We had ordered chicken manchow soup which was average, did not like it that there was capsicum in it.Food was not oily which was good and it was delivered real quick so food was piping hot."
4,Dish :1. Neer Dose and Fish CurryTaste : 4.5 / 52. Anjal Rava FryTaste : 3.5 / 53. Prawns Pepper DryTaste : 4.5 / 5Place : Kadalu ( vijaynagar )Ambience : 3/5Service : 4 / 5Value for money : 3.8 / 5Had bookmarked ths place since so long n finally decided to visit.... My first impression after reaching the place was should i really try here ? Will the food be tasty ?... It was completely empty with just 2 staffs... Later i thght lemme give a try... Neer dose was soft and fish curry was so awesome with mild spices n balance of flavours ( perfect combination though) ... Anjal rava fry was perfectly coated in rava n deep fried... But i felt it could have been spicier ...prawns pepper dry was really good...Both Fish and the prawns were fresh n cooked to perfection.... Ambience was just ok nothing great.. Service was quick and i felt it was lil pricey for the Rava fish fry... Overall it was really satisfying... It is definitely a must try ??
4,"Try this place for some good milkshakes, Ice cream jar and the newly introduced waffles!? a perfect place to visit in evening and late night. Nutty chocolate is the best amongst all other shakes! Have been ordering it through zomato with no complaints till now? seating arrangements in all outlets would make it a perfect place!"
5,This is the outlet of frozen bottle I visit the most and enjoy the most . IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâve tried almost all shakes . And icecreams too. CouldnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât try the scoops but got to try their new addition waffles. Waffles are perfectly crispy and sweet. Decent amount of chocolate sauce and toppings too . The benches are quite attractive here .My ratingService - 5Food-5Ambience- 5
4,Best place for milkshakes then Keventers.. Price is pocket friendly and we do get icecreams don't forget to try caramel icecream ?? one amazing thing ?
4,Sweets and snacks are good and are of good quality. They do sell good samosas. It's located exactly in KIMS junction near BDA and Devegowda petrol bunk
5,"Simple sweet shop. Just at the signal junction. Price is cheap compared to Anand sweets. Many times, i have purchased cham cham and jahangeer sweets, it was good."
1,They don't home deliver. Please update the details its misleading. Even they are not courteous to listen to the query. Please take them off from Zomato.
4.5,A very old place near Kim's college. Sweets are fresh and delicious.Rasgullas are pretty good and the flavours are proper not too salty or tangy.
3.5,Quite decent sweets and chats. Reasonable prices. A South Indian sweet shop. Location is okay. Cleanliness is acceptable by everyone. Check for past day's sweets.
3,Situated opposite to KIMS at Banashankari 2nd stage this is a decent sweet shop which provides reasonably good sweets and mixtures.. Bengali sweets are average though.. Prices are reasonable..
4,Tandoori chicken was really good yesterday. Special chicken dry was not that great but they can improve the same. You need to ask them to make it spicy which may be good to taste. Special chicken dry is basically chicken coated with egg and fried. They need to maintain the same quantity of even increase for same prices.
4,Good Location. Small restaurant.Nice tasty snacks. Had many items here. Snacks are very good. Tea n coffee to all juices available.Yesterday had Sharjah the same taste of kerala.Very good experience
5,"You get the best desserts in town here! From variety to flavour,they have something new to offer every time. I am a fan of their chocolate and red velvet cakes."
5,"If you are a cake fan then,'The Big O Bakes' is just the perfect place for you! They have the most fantastic and delicious chocolate cakes and you are just spoilt for choice every single time."
5,The best red velvet cupcakes in town....Be it the cake or the cupcakes they are worth dying for. I have also tried the seasonal flavours they are just amazing!! Always a favourite..Recommend ????
1,"Pathetic .don't even consider of ordering your cupcakes from here as they will not be available ,idk what they up to. Doesn't pick calls at time. Tells to order after a week and fails to pick. This is not how you treat the costumers!!"
5,"They bake and serve the best customised cakes ever. You name it and you get it, with a wide range of lip-smacking special flavours. You will relish every bite that melts in your mouth.  You get what you expect and its totally worth every rupee you pay. the best part of these bakers are that they never say NO! its always a positive reply and bake in any size from a needle to the aeroplane. Each cake is perfectly shaped and moulded. Suitable for any and every occasion if you haven't placed your order yet its time to place it soon :)"
5,They are masters in Cake.I got my PINK FLOYD cake from this bakery shop and it is the best cake i ever had and it was a master piece the way it was done.Highly recommended place.
5,"There's a difference between cake and CAKE and that's the bench mark TBOB has set. Absolutely love the dark chocolate salted caramel cake & the seasonal strawberry cream cake which i ordered recently.Bakes: 5/5Quantity: 5/5Service: 5/5Good job, Lakhan!"
5,"So it's Valentine's Day and you're still waiting for somebody to pamper you!This was me until I ordered the cake in a jar! So stop waiting and get ordering! Now!The jars look so good and delicious that I did not feel like opening them and finishing it!It's the perfect flavours as it comes in strawberry, red velvet and my all time favourite chocolate!The big o bakes is definitely the next place I order cakes from!Yummy in your tummy guaranteed!"
1,"Disappointing.When I call to order, they say it's closed for a few days.After a few days, when I order on zomato, they refuse to accept my order."
5,"One of the best place in BSK to get all your desserts & celebration cakes. Cakes are crafted to perfection, love their vintage & chic cakes. And coming down to desserts, I vouch for their banoffee pie, red velvet cake, Nutella cupcakes, #BestEver ? and more over this is run by an independent owner who's just 20yrs old and absolutely killing it. Good job Lakhan."
5,"So I've ordered from Lakhan about 2 times now and have had the most wonderful experience! His cakes are just so amazing ! They are always better than what you'd expect ! The red velvet cupcakes are to die for ! And he customises the cakes/ cupcakes to near perfection ! Would definitely recommend ordering from here the next time you need to celebrate a special occasion ! Tried the shooter cupcakes with baileys and jack Daniels and man were they amazing! Even if you don't have any idea about what flavours go together ,don't worry ,he'll guide you thought it :) also the price is very reasonable and if you request ,he's kind enough to deliver it to you as well !Nitheesha Daka"
5,"The big o bakes is one of the best places to get well made, exquisite and luxurious cupcakes. Their cupcakes are a must try and I strongly suggest people to try their cupcakes and custom cakes"
5,"Well, TBOB is one the best place to have cupcakes and customised cakes. I regularly order from TBOB. Their cakes are very neatly done in terms of fondant detailing. Their cupcakes are just mind blowing. Especially red velvet with cream cheese and chocolate cupcake with Nutella filling. Customised cakes are brilliantly done. Designs in TBOB are very unique. It is one of the best place in banglore for dessert lover's. Highly recommended. Thumps upValue for money : 5/5Taste : 5/5Design : 5/5Presentation :5/5"
4.5,"One of the Youngest baker in town I must say, Well i have tried red velvet cup cakes which is brilliant n you can never miss out on variety ! All of their cake flavours are amazing ""You can dream a cake to any extent "" I would highly recommend you for wedding cakes"
5,"Hands down !! This is the best place for brownies and desserts , there is no way one can't deny this fact after having tasted their cup cakes , muffins and tarts they remain on top of my list of favourites !! Their customised cakes are WORK OF ART , brilliant work well designed and very neat ! This place is the only place you should think of for any occasions for that matter !! Must try their macaroons , strawberry sensation , key lime pie , banana muffins and JD truffles I assure you , an orgasmic experience ! ?"
5,"Their customized cakes are one of the best ways of surprising someone! Be it any cake, it just melts in your mouth. They have the best chocolate cakes. Red velvet with cream cheese is a must try!"
5,"Red Velvet fan?They've got the BEST RED VELVET CAKES. ?I regularly order from TBOB, they are just too addictive and every time I call them to place an order they've got something new on board. ?"
5,"Ordered their cakes, cupcakes and other motherlovin' goodies. When perfection is executed and delivered each and every time you know it is made by a baking god. Ordered cakes for my birthday... Will order in the future for my bachelor party, wedding and baby shower, hopefully in this order ?Cheers."
5,"This place beats almost every other dessert place there is in town! Was very low profile so far and I'm glad that it's finally out and ready!! I get all the birthday cakes here, my cupcakes and almost everything sweet from here!Very decently priced as well!If you're in Bangalore and want something for someone's birthday or even for a guilty binge, this is the place!!"
2,"Meghana foods!!! The name itself is more than enough to get you drooling over their biriyanis!! They have always been spicy and nice( unfortunate not this time ??‍??) Yes I had a bad experience in Meghana foods!!! As shocking as it seems it was bad(it was too sweet to be true...Pun intended).. but the starter was amazing ?? My reviewFood 2.5/5 (4.5/5 for the ""before taste"")Service 3/5Ambience 3/5Cost for 2 700-800"
5,"This is one of the best biryanis I've ever had. The Meghana special, while chicken, is still brilliant. The tandoori chicken is also pretty great. Looking forward to trying their mutton variants."
3,Service is too slow and need to wait for 1 hour for 30min for having food ??? they don't even take reservations properly ?and biryani is not that good compared to paradise biryani in terms of veg biryani.
5,"One of the best briyani I had at the end of 2018 ??..I had their special chicken briyani & mutton keema briyani. The @meghanabiryani is an Andhra style restuarant serving delicious nonveg dishes in Bengaluru. The briyani was very tasty & the taste clearly showed they've used only natural spices in briyani...Overall it was a great experience in Meghanas Restuarant, So I would rate ?????..#food #foodtalkindia #indianfoodie #foodtravelers #foodphoto #foodtalkindia #foodindia #foodphotographer #foodpics"
4,"Till now the best Biriyani I have tasted.Meghan's chicken boneless biriyani is to die for .Meghan's have maintained ter taste ,from 6 yes I m visiting this place and I am not bored of food .Panner biriyani resembles taste of boneless biriyani for vegetarians .Gravy ,roti's ,Non starters I'll give it a 3 star.Only Fr biriyani u can visit this place.Nice ambience ,bit crowded always."
5,"I am very happy to give this place a five star rating, the taste of the Biriyani deserves it. I loved it. When we visited, it was pretty crowded but their service was spot on. The food was spicy yet yum. The quantity was filling and apt for money. Kudos."
5,"If you want good biryani, this is the place to be at. It's worth every penny that you would be spending.The chicken lollipop, prawn biryani and the Meghana Special Biryani is absolutely fantastic, and also my favourite picks of Meghana Foods.This place is always crowded, be it a weekday or weekend, so you might have to wait for your turn. But their service is super quick.This place is a must if you are new or visiting Bangalore."
5,"Lemon chicken was so tender , fresh and juicy , am glad that the restaurant staff suggested us to order , the biriyaanis were too good !!! We had ordered lollypop biriyaani which was serverd with the 3 lollypop toppings , another was special biriyaaani were scrambled lemon flavoured chicken was topped on the biriyaaani bowl , found it expensive but worth giving the bugs"
4,"Meghana foods is very famous for its boneless biryani and also boneless starters, and taste is good and the quantity is more. I have tried many starters all of them are good and they are also boneless"
5,I have been to this place couple of times best place for biriyani lovers the biriyani rice is so spicy and mouth watering .One of my favourite from the menu is lemon chicken and meghanas special biriyani .This place is crowded all the time weekend we have to wait for an hour but end of the day waiting is worth for the place.
3,"Biryani is comfort food and Uber Eats (not sponsored! ) makes the ordering process so easy and affordable.We sisters, often order Dum Aloo Biryani home when we're having the Netflix and chill kinda days.They deliver the package in a jute bag with raita and a spicy sidedish along with the Biryani. A packet of Biryani is definitely enough for two individuals.The Biryani is superbly cooked in the authentic style, flavors oozing out in every bite.Definitely the best biryani I've tasted! Highly recommended!"
3,"I have been an ardent biryani fan especially all the meghana joints in Bangalore.Visited this place on a weekend night for dinner. Ordered chilli chicken as a starter which was not apt. I found it directly out of the oil deep fried. No taste and fill of oil. Very blank.Also, ordered naan and butter chicken which was good in taste. Also ordered chicken boneless biryani. The biryani was very average, it was very spicy that literally burnt my stomach and throat. Not sure if something was wrong that particular day but did not like it.Overall can try once."
3,"They are popular for their biryani. Ordered chicken dum biryanis. Food was delivered on time and the packaging was good. Portion size was just right, enough for one person. Taste was also good but the there was too much white rice so the masala was not consistent.Overall food experience was good but nothing extraordinary."
4,If you visit bangalore and want to have the most famous biryani than this the right place. This place has a never ending list of biryani. Each biryani has its own taste.
1,"Worst experience with Krishna sagar.. I ordered panner butter masala, masala itself not good. Even roti also, it looks like chapati I never expected from this hotel. Guys please never buy anything from this hotel.. I had thrown next moment."
3.5,Quiet small place... But food is nice and very cheap... Looking out for cheap north indian food this is the place to visit. Although negative point is taste varies day to day... Some time food is great but some time it is worse... Famous for his thali for the students nearby
1,"We wanted to try everything in the area as we were new there. I didn't wanted to go there (seeing the smoke and cleaning), but anyway, we went. Ordered combo thali, ate 2 chapati and that's it. We sworn, not to come to this place anymore. Ambiance is of course not good. But unlike paratha house, food is also not good. I wouldn't recommend it."
3.5,Very nice place for north Indian eat out. But this place was not clean. Food is fresh and they made against the order. A best place for north Indian food lovers with low budget.
3,When just late to work eateries like this work on!!Landed up here for breakfast which I did parcel ..took idli it was nice soft with chutney and sambharPrices are quite cheapPlace was clean and neat
3.5,A perfect place for budget Non-veg food.A very nice North Indian eat out.Not so clean though.But food is fresh and made against the order.Nothing more to say about this place.
5,Perfect place for engineering students in need of north indian foodGreat food at very low prices bhindi masala n panner kolhapuri are a must try with butter chapatiesDon't expect ambience just enjoy the food
3.5,"A good place to have lunch or dinner almost everyday, they provide, tasty and good quality food, at a very much affordable price, don't keep your expectations high like the usual hifi restaurants, it is a very small restaurant for the budget people,.The main attractions are the combos, and the thaali. Roti's are made of wheat and is healthy.Granite tables and granite benches are provided to sit and dine."
3.5,North India food style Good in taste service also not bad with in budget good for casual lunch and dinner seating arrangement were not upto the mark
5,"Tried the rose and chocolate macaroon, loved it ! Crisp , soft and chewy with a delicious filling! Rose macaroon is a must try ! kudos to this one - it was perfectly balanced - Mild yet we get the hit of rose flavour .. yum !??"
4,One of the famous biriyani place everyone would love to eat .. quality has decreased over time but still worth eating... if the quality is maintained as it was years ago still can take first place
5,Hotel chickpet Donne biryani house is the best place for all biryani lover.Very good taste of biryani.With reachable price.And awesome taste.Best place for family dining
3,This places serves amazing biryani. Had been here for lunch. A small well maintained outlet in Banashankari. Place will be very crowded because of tasty food.Had biryani rice and chicken pepper dry. Their biriyani is quiet different from what other restaurants serve. It's a different rice with some masala. But it tastes amazing. Worth having. 1st time tried something different kind of biryani. Chicken pepper dry was ok. Didn't like much.Service is too fast. We just ordered and within 5 mins they served.Pocket friendly place to have tasty biryani. If you are a biryani lover give it a try!
4,"This is a small hotel. Nothing extravagant about it. But it serves amazing biriyani!! If u are looking for a pocket friendly nonveg food with good taste, this is the place!You can even walk in with ur pajamas.Family friendly hotel. No drinking or smoking.You have home delivery too and you get good quantity!"
1,"Do not order anything. This restaurant is so irresponsible they do not even answer calls. I had ordered cake for my daughter birthday via zomato at 11:54am however it was confirmed that the order will be delivered before 3:00pm same day. However, zomato does not know what to do and they say restaurant is not receiving our calls."
1,My order never reached me and the delivery boy's number was never sent. The guy who was coordinating with the order told me that I'd receive my order in a while and stopped receiving my calls soon. Really disappointed and dissatisfied after waiting for so long for a birthday cake to come and be disappointed and disappoint others on someone's birthday. Really bad service. I wish I could rate a 0 for this place cause I didn't even get a chance to be positive and appreciate them for something atleast.
2,The place is definitely good for ice creams but talking about the concerns the manger is very rude.They do not treat customers well and behave in a very rude manner.No matter the ice creams and flavors are really good.A mannerism is important.
4,I am in great love with natural ice creams.. This branch especially maintains a wide variety of flavours and close to my place.. One of my favourite in recent times is the gulkand flavour.. A good place to hang out for an ice cream and is maintained well..
5,Excellent taste in town and variety of flavours of natural Icecream and best in class of taste and also the milkshakes with all natural and healthy
3,"Ididnt like much.Need to improve in food, ambience awesome, service fantastic.Biryani was good and south Indian meals was good but chicken65 worst"
4,My favorite place since childhood. Visited this place yesterday and did have their awesome veg puff's along with paneer pizza piece. It was really good. Lots more to explore!
1,The quality of foods are very very bad.
5,The food is really great. The atmosphere is really Okay. The prices are perfectly fine. The quantity is a lot for your money. I would recommend this restaurant.
4,For all the meat lovers specifically this place is a must visit for Persian delicaciesThe ambience is rustic and beautiful.Not very often will you find the place too crowded.Do ask for assistance with the order unless u are accompanied by Iranian friends
4,"Tried their joojeh, kobideh and hasiri dishes. All were really good and different. This place near bda complex stands out among the competition. Restaurant is empty more often than not and people prefer take away to dine in"
5,"Omg, really good here! Totally worth it. You guys have to try this place if you are fan of Arabic-ish kind of food! And totally worth the money!"
3.5,This place is slightly difficult to find even though it is exactly near BDA. First of all; the restaurant was completely empty which didn't give us the correct impression that the eatery is doing well. We ordered the Kobideh Kebab. It came with a huge platter of Basmati Rice and some curry to accompany with it. It was my first time with Persian Cuisine so can't verify the authenticity but the taste was really good. It was really filling and I feel it was a good value for money. It would obviously have been better if we had fellow visitors at the restaurant. Otherwise a good place to visit.Amartya Amit Baran Roy
3.5,"Had a plate of Sulthani. Not sure if it was authentic Persian but it tasted good indeed. It's a nice place, with kind and generous people. The Persian dishes seems to be a little overpriced."
3.5,"If ur looking to try some persian cuisine . U should try this place. Although almost everything on the menu is yummy nd nice ,its better to go with some iranian friends at least for the first time to guide u on what to order .you could also ask for suggestions once you go to the restaurant . The menu includes some of the foods pictures to get a better idea on how the food looks like , since you wont know what the names mean and what kind of food it will be .read the menu and ask the waiter ,then go for it. The food is very nice and kebabs will be served with red cabbage pickles ,lemon pieces,onion rings,barbecued tomato . Rice or naan according to ur choice. Your order doesnt take too long to come . Ive been to this place many a times and definitely recommend this place for all the foodies who love trying different kinds of food and different cuisins ."
5,"Love, love, love their food. I've been ordering food from Ayda for over 2 years now and have never been disappointed. My go to menu is kabab sheshliks, korma sabzi and hummus. The lamb is perfectly cooked, juicy and succulent. I can usually just eat their plain rice, well, plain. It's that good. Don't forget to try their mast mosar (?). It's a lovely creamy yogurt with a hint of garlic.What's more, their service is amazing!"
3,"very good food, nice ambiance but prices Lil High compare to facilitation!!!"
2.5,"average food. we ordered joojeh lohmei, a chicken dish. Chicken was very dry for my palate.Ambience - AC does not work. Light switches off is middle of dinner.All in all an average restaurant. Would not visit again."
3.5,"If you are looking for a good Persian/Iranian food - than Ayda is the place!Ambiance(3.5/5)Located on the first floor opposite BDA complex, this restaurant is hard to find. The restaurant is quite small - can hardly accommodate 20 people. The interior ambiance is spartan and is purely functional. Normally, this restaurant is not crowded and I have seen only Arab students in this restaurant.Service (4.5/5)The waiters and captain are very courteous, very helpful, and are eager to serve you. The restaurant area being a small place helps in getting a great service.Coming to food (4/5). I find the food very authentic. Like traditional Iranian cuisine - the food is primarily centered around meat and kababs. Food is non-spicy and yet quite flavorful.Overall, this is a good place to go for a change or if you are looking for a good Persian/Arab food."
5,i liked it because i regularly go the one in church street & they have maintained the same taste in both branches.....for my review you may check the church street review whihc i posted
4,"I've had food from Chatar Patar many times. My favourites here are the corn and mayo sandwich and the dahi papdi chat. The place is clean, economical and super quick service. I'd definitely recommend this place."
4,"My Go to place for late night dessert cravings especially when I don't feel like driving out. Usually call for a Death By Chocolate to be delivered and it still tastes extremely good. Only rivaled by Corner House, the chocolate cake within the DBC is made really well. They serve the chocolate sauce separately in a parcel which stays hot and tastes good. All in all a must try where ever you stay. And don't hesitate to order in"
3,The taste which is similar like every other polar bear.The ambience is quite nice and a cozy place to recommend.This store is bigger compared to other polar bear store but the service is not quite good as the staff is not polite and little rude and impatient
4,If you are looking for pure south Indian authentic food in Bengaluru then this place is amazing. My first visit to Bengaluru and first restaurant in the city and really happy with the food. One suggestion for everyone please wait till last dish to come because they have good variety in buffet.
3,"Centrally located restaurant,Reasonably priced menu,fairly decorated atmosphere Average quality food and poor service .Should increase quality and variety of food"
4,"they serve authentic kannada/ iyangar style food which very tasty and good and neat.it's simple menu, fills stomach and it's unlimited. guys with good appetite will enjoy the food..they serve only in lunch hours and not for dinner"
3,Decent place for a South Indian food... itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs quite economical and the service is also good... u always find a place... do drop in if u r in mood for simple South Indian without wasting much of time and money... service has become pathetic... they wonÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât even respond if u call
2.5,"Decent Roof Top ambience.Taste of the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't quite exquisite/authentic either - We have certainly had tastier South Indian meals elsewhere. Restaurant wasn't even half full on a Saturday afternoon.All in all, there's nothing exceptional about this place."
1.5,Doesn't offer what is marketedServes you cold dry food for which is superior be a lunch only place ( thali )Not good on taste quality and and priced heavy2 overallNo recommendation
3.5,"Good location, wish they put the fans on when they saw their customers sweating. Food was good south indian food with mild spice levels. Service was good as well but sometimes they would put food for only some people at the table and not ask the others."
1,"This second floor restaurant has a vast space, comfortable seating. The place has no breeze even though it is a rooftop restaurant. They do not even have good fans, we were sweating throughout the course of our eating. All side dishes were pathetic except one kurma for the late arrival poories. The rice was gastric flavoured, the service was so pathetic that the guys were asking for a translation for every dish needed. The management was rubbish."
4,"Had visited this place on a Sunday afternoon (30th April 2017) and found it sparingly occupied at 2pm.I think food prepared here changes daily and depends on the day. We were served beetroot palya, heerekai kootu, kosambari,chutney,chapati,puliyogere,chilly bajji, papad,curd,buttermilk,shavige paaysa,rice,rasam,sambar and majjige huli.The only thing that was not good was the chilly bajji as it was cold and it was bit oily. Rest of the items were very good. All the items clearly tasted like home cooked food.Service was also good and didn't feel it was slow. They property attended to serve when items were getting empty."
3.5,"This indeed was a pleasant surprise. Probably the best of the lot in BSK 2nd stage for vegetarian meal. Ambience is simple and nice. The poori and saagu was the highlight of the meal. I got to know that generally they serve chapathis but the day we went they had pooris. The Huli(Sambar) was very good. Saaru(Rasam) could have been better. Shavige payasa, Happala(papad), mensinkai bajji(mirchi) were all good too. Food served on plantain leaf is always a delight. Definitely a winner on hand"
3,"The food is good, not very great but totally worth the price. If you not very particular about authentic South Indian then you can try the place otherwise it might turn out to be a little disappointing."
2.5,"Leaves you with a very unfulfilling experience with expecting a lot more from this restaurant because of its location and it is advertisement of cuisine. Bad service. Hardly anyone asks what u need. Average cuisine, average service... location is good but not so good food quality and dining experience."
3.5,"Nice place to have south Indian meals . nice rooftop ambience. The staff served us well. We were served on a plantain leaf. This place is located above hara , near the banashabkari bda complex."
3.5,Kidambi's Kitchen a rooftop restaurant. You get tat refreshing feel when you enter the restaurant. Traditional south Indian meals served on plaintain leaf. The food was good. The service was good n the staff was friendly too. The meal is unlimited. Value for your money and last but not the least the desert was awsm :-)
3,"Ambience might not be the greatest suite but the dosas are. But, next time try filtering cockroaches outta your upma coz it's disgusting to find one in middle of a hogging."
4,ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a main road facing self service with limited place hotel near 1947- 100 feet ring road.Food is amazing!Open dosa and coffee to finish off.
2,Quality & taste got degraded day by day. This is not earlier famous Mane Thindi anymore. Not worth to visit this. Better to go across. 0.5 km ahead is the best Thaaza Thindi.
3.5,"Combo is the best item to have in this place , good taste and coffee tastes good ambience is not that good but for a quick bite it is ok to have here"
3,"Average place for having quick south Indian bites .It is located on the main road near Kamakya theatre and can be easily located.The service is fast and you won't have to wait long for the food. There are no seating arrangements except a few tables to stand and eat.The taste is average,many places serve better at the same rate.The chief concern is the hygiene of the place which is very poor .The staff should try to improve the situation."
3.5,An affordable place to have quick South Indian bites.They offer a number of dosa varieties and snacks.The place is always jam packed and they do not have seating options.The service is really fast and you won't have to wait much even when it is crowded.Personal favourites are the Benne Masala dosa and Avarakalu dosa.Highly recommended if you are on the look for tasty bites at affordable rates.
3,"Located on the main road when you're travelling from D.G Petrol bunk towards Kamakya theatre it's easily identifiable with a huge board stating it's name. It's a small eating joint with no seating area available.The food is average compared to the prices. They do have delivery system available and the packaging is neat. My concern cropped up with a couple of my colleagues fell ill after eating from Mane Thindi.So,hygiene could be one of the concerns. However, I didn't face anything as such personally till now.If you're looking for a quick breakfast or snack you can give it a try."
4,"Had the ""jumbo thindi"" combo !!Contains Idly, small dosa, vada etc.All tasted good. Crowd was more though.If you are near Kamakya or BSK, it's must visit ;)"
2.5,Cost is more Food qty not worth
3,"Average. Had an avarekalu dosa, somewhat of a seasonal specialty, but was strictly so so. Either the dosa bater or the masala had too much salt. Overall not bad, but nothing great.abyventura.wordpress.com"
4,"Brilliant place for a quick breakfast. If you're the filling food freak, there's a good option called the jumbo tindi which is really good for what it costs. Also Bread, Averakalu dosa are must tries"
3,"The place serves the typical South Indian food. Along with idli and vada, tried the bread and avarekalu dosa. It was good and worth the money. However crowded most of the time."
3.5,A good place to have a quick breakfast. The place is crowded sometimes and there is no seating arrangement. I tried marsala dosa and idli - vada and I liked both.
2.5,"Pathetic service,. I ordered for an Open Dosa and they didnt give me ""Sagu"" the Veg Kurma. I requested the person, he was very arrogant and told me in kannada ""sagu kodalla"" means i will not give Sagu..Pathetic service, all waiters have huge attitude problem.. not at all clean."
3.5,"It's just like every other small, self-service joints. Usually too crowded. The food is pretty decent, but not exceptional. The prices are quite low, which is a bonus. The place is quite hygienic too!I'll just give it a general rating. It's too common, to warrant section-wise ratings."
3.5,"Do not get fooled by the board ......its just regular darshini .....they serve usual idli ,dosa,karabath etc.....but thing I love the most is the breakfast combo ...You get also almost all the breakfast items on it and price is also less.....the taste of the food is pretty good .....items like dosa they haven't mastered it yet .....the dosa is either roasted too much or less or perfect ....it keeps varying .....but given the fact its one of the few darshini in banashakari area its definitely a thumbs up from side......prices are nominal .....Ambience is good ( self service only) no seating place ......the place is extremely clean and the service quite fast although its crowded during weekend morning rush hour ..........do visit this restaurant if your in the area.....or passing through devegowda petrol bunk."
4,"Awesome place for a breakfast or a snack. I usually go there every 2 or 3 days. Superb Ghee dosa, but vada should be had only if hot else doesn't taste so good. Overall good taste.... especially nearby that area..."
1,"Small darshini located on beside the dusty ring road. Looks crowded but it's not. As it is a small joint 4 people standing looks like crowded. I had breakfast in morning around 10.45 idly was not hot, vada is hard, sambar, Chutney is too mild. Conjusted kitchen for staff. hygiene is very low. Not recommended. Coffee is ok."
4,"There is no link to the name of restaurant mane thindi to food served it's a darshini which serve regular dosa, idli, chow chow bath etc with 1 spl dish of the day.Taste of food is better than regular darshini. The place is on Main road after kamakya. Parking car is a issue."
3.5,"If you're a Bangalorian, then you would love the ""Darshini"" culture here, which I haven't really seen in any other cities.Mane thindi, is one such typical Bangalorian Darshini and a good one too.For a Darshini the ambience is not bad, staff are friendly service is super fast.Now the food I ordered was something different, a ""bread dosa"". Yeiks, worst decision ever! They put fried bread pieces on the dosa and together it was so oily that I really couldn't finish it. We also tried ""avare Kalu"" dosa which was relatively ok.On the other hand my dad had a normal Masala dosa, and that actually tasted really good. So, if you ever go there don't fall for the name and order something new, rather just stick to the usual :P"
4,"This is a perfect breakfast place, right on the outer ring road, half way between devegowda petrol bunk and kamakya theatre.This place specialises in dosas and their ""jumbo thindi""They have exotic dosas like averebele dose, bread dose among others, which taste excellent.The jumbo thindi: this is a winner with a cute little masala dosa, a bowl of khara an kesari bhath, a single idly, vada and a small bowl of pongal. This is worth the money one pays for breakfast.The service is poor as the waiters are busy chit chatting among themselves...Must have: bread dosa, jumbo thindiMust visit for a quick breakfast!"
4,"The only restaurant that I prefer for breakfast on all the days near BSK III Stage. Had Idlys, Dosas and tried all their items in the menu which gives me a real good start for the day. A must place to visit!"
4,Located on the main road next to cake of the day..This is a fab place to have fast food at cheap prices.Masala dosas and goli bajji are a must try here...Their speciality is the avarekayi dosa that is available almost all the days a year...
3,"One of the First person to visit this place as it is located close to my House. Was Excited to see that there was a Hotel coming up in this area in Bsk 3rd stage Near Kamakya theatre. But after tasting it, i was Really dissapointed. Though its close, I Dnt feel like visiting it again.. It is a fast food South Indian hotel.. Which serves Idly, Vada, Dosa & other things.I felt The Chutney here is Not good. I think they need to improvise on it. Sambar is also Average like any other hotel. I wonder how there is so much of crowd in this place.. I guess its bcoz there is no other Hotel near by for a quick Breakfast. Ambience is good.Overall 3 stars.. A lot of Improvisation required."
5,"One of the best hotels I liked so far, I visit almost every every week and and Great taste. Liked all their food and Maintains good cleanliness and hygiene."
3,"We come here if not often, occasionally to reload on some fat fuel...Thupadu Dose and Avarekalu Dose channagi itthu illi. My husband's typical eat out...But after eating recently here a lot of my family members fell sick so thumbs down.."
4,A good place for a delicious South Indian dish experience.. The taste is good and the service is also good.. Overall a simple and best restaurant!!
4.5,I love this place for their tastiest khana!!!!!!During the avarekayi season...they make avarekayi dose....its totally worth what u pay!!!!!!amazing extraordinary taste...with butter melting on the dosa...!!!slurp!!The chutneys are toooo goood!!!!
4.5,Tasty breakfast. Yummiest chutney. Jumbo thindi is a must try. Kesaribhat and karabhat tastes just like mommy's made them. Avarekal dose is my fav here :)
4,Awesome breakfast at affordable price.The must order jumbo thindi.The sambar was not upto the mark but rest was just awesme.luved the kesari.
4,They serve mouth watering breakfast dishes all the breakfast items are gud the combo mark is cheap n best here..
3.5,Very much affordable for breakfast n south indian fast food.....Recommended item- jumbo thindi..
5,"Best mini foood place,wrthy,tidy place nice variety of dosas,soft idily,tasty kesaribath,crispy vada with complimentary tea n coffee,with worth price visit often classy taste everyone should try."
3.5,Their Jumbo thindi is famous. but no standard. Sometimes the dosa will be too oily
4,Nice darshini near devegowda petrol bunk. all items are moderately tasty although some of their daily special items are so so... rates are moderate....
4,Very fast service and delicious food.I've been there almost every weekend and never disappointed.
1,Arrogant service. Nothing special about this. Standard fare. Why visit?
3.5,Food tastes good! Here... :-) but maintainence is poor:-( workers vl b cleaning o doing something while v r eating oly:-(
1,Bad cold Masala dosa. Arrogant and rude manager and staff.
3.5,"Easily locatable.. on the main Katriguppe road.. Mane Thindi is easily one of the best south Indian food outlet in the area.. Don't hesitate to visit this place since this is a fast food restaurant..Very cleanly maintained... the dosas,idlis are good.. They have this ""jumbo thindi"" which is a combination of the idlis,kharabath,kesaribaths ..Coffees,teas..excellentIf you are in the mood for a quick stroll and some tasty south indian food..a must visit"
4.5,Amazing and the best dosas And the service is really fast...
4,Not many darshinis in blore maintain the quality that this darshini does. Variety of dosas. Coffee and tea are the best. Parking is a mess. You should park on the other side of the ring road.
3.5,"Nice place fast service and variety tindis, a olage for working professionals to grab a bite and go :-)"
3.5,"A welcome change in ring road area. I like the food served here. Famous for its all encompassing jumbo breakfast combo, i like the ideaSambhar are bit spicy for my liking but are compensated with fresh goli bhajisi go with 3.5 for Mane Tindi's breakfast spread"
4,Food is very tasty! Typical Mangalorean cuisine with affordable prices! Must visit if you have to treat a huge group of friends who can eat a lot of non veg! ?!
5,The place is really cheap and tasty i would suggest to take a parcel than sitting there and having the food. The food is fresh here prepared according to order. The ambience is not good for family
5,The best mangalor style food I ever had in bangalore... The owner and the staff are very humble.. U can taste exact mangalore recipe.. And neer dosa is my favourite.... Guys do visit this hotel once u ppl will love the food....
5,"THE BEST?sea food that one can have in Bangalore. Still got the hangover of the anjal masala fry that we had. Seafood @such affordable price, really appreciable. Its been couple of times now we took home delivery and each time its been mouthwatering and palatable. All the best to KOTIAN's team?. U r the best. Can u share your secret recipe?plzz?"
5,The cakes have the perfect amount of sweet and light. The red velvet cupcakes are just too good and have the best chocolate cakes.Thank you for the wonderful cupcakes and for my birthday cake
5,"To be honest, I feel Floured is really under rated. Their red velvet cake was the best cake that I had ever eaten! So creamy and just one bite of it and you go like ''mmmmmmÌÄåÄÌâå¡ÌÄåâÌÄåâÌÄåâ"".Very fresh and so beautiful looking too!! Would totally recommend everybody to try them out. Birthday parties, weddings, events or even just to make yourself feel better, these cakes know their way! ÌÄåÄÌâå¡ÌÄåâÌÄåâÌÄåâ"
5,"My friends surprised me with red velvet cupcakes from these guys and it was amazing, not too sweet, moist and delicious, just how I like it!Thanks for making my day more special guys! Can't wait to try your other delicacies as well!"
5,Neatly done...grt taste...very moist...and most importantly done as it is said...will definetly recommend...eggless baking with a great taste...it is truly baked with love..
5,The best red velvet cupcakes I have ever eaten. Every bite of it just melts in mouth. And the butter cream frosting is delicious. Both in taste and presentation I give them 10 on 10.NO ONE CAN EAT JUST ONE ÌÄåÄÌâå¡ÌÄåâÌÄåâÌÄåâ
5,Thanks Keshav and Anita for the lovely birthday cake. It was exactly the same as in the pic that I shared. Cake was delivered intact and on time. All at the party enjoyed the velvety cake. My son thought the dinosaur on top is a real toy. I am sure to think of you guys as the first option while ordering cake for all future occassions
5,The best gift for my mum on her birthday.. Yummy cupcakes with a theme that is close to my mum (a home chef) .. The theme was beautifully shown and also tasted very yummy.. They were very punctual with the delivery as well...
5,The cupcakes were really amazing! The themes were so prominent those skills are really appreciated ! Red velvet especially were too good ! Loved them ÌÄåÄÌâå¡ÌÄåâÌÄåâÌÄåâ
5,One day my wife said we needed to celebrate our daughter's half year birthday- I said Ok...the search was then on for the perfect cake. We came to know of the couple who run this home style bakery from our relative; the community where they stay have 'Floured' as their regular baker for specialty cakes. They delivered us a red velvet cake with vanilla butter icing with a cute sculpture on top. The cake was moist and the icing made with real butter. It was so good that we saved the leftover for ourselves rather than sharing it with others (which was the actual plan).  It is undoubtedly one of the best I have had till now. A big heartfelt thanks to Anitha and Keshav for the special cake for the special occasion.
4,"When I was looking up for some homemade innovate cakes for my brothers birthday. I found this page on Facebook, I was take by surprise to see cakes which had intricate decorations but made to perfection.It is run by Anitha and Keshav. It's been 8 months and almost for every birthday and marriage of my family I have ordered cakes from here. I have been impressed with the designs and taste.The best cake so far has been chocolate cake with vanilla cream. If you want go with less sugar for cakes or icing/cream they will do it as per requirement. They even delivery it to the required place. Even though it is little costly but surely it is worth every penny.Surely one should order from here."
5,"I ordered a customized vanilla cake with chocolate buttercream for my fiance who lives in Bangalore. Since I don't live in Bangalore, I opted to go through zomato for a decent bakery to get the cake delivered. I was worried how it would turn out to be and whether it would be delivered in midnight or not but keshav and anitha did a fab job. The cake turned out to be exactly like I wanted and was delivered right on time. My fiance loved the cake which had a human topper with a video game console and beer bottles since he is a big video game buff and said it was delicious. Very happy to choose floured. Thanks for the experience keshav and anitha!"
5,"The cake looked beautiful. It was exactly how I wanted it! The cake was very creamy and soft.I loved the flavours- it wasnÌÄåÄÌâå¢ÌÄåâÌÄåât too sweet like many cakes, it was a perfect balance.All in all, one of the best cakes IÌÄåÄÌâå¢ÌÄåâÌÄåâve had."
5,"I ordered for a chocolate cake with chocolate ganache filling and topped chocolate buttercream..thats the most amount of chocolate anyone could think of.f.. to top it up the cakee was decorated with rochers and kitkat. The cake was not over poweringly sweet, which is every chocolate lovers paradise. The balance of the buttercream and ganache was perfect. Each layer had its own flavour, which struck chords to the most delightful taste. Thank you Floured for customising the order, having a professional approach and delivering the cake on time. My favourite would still be the dulce le leche brownies with walnuts. This was truely orgasmic as my friend called it.. its nothing like ibhave ever had before ... every bite, left you wanting for more. A must try for all the chocolate lovers."
5,Awesome Cupcakes.... Were a star fr my day... A true icing on the cake!! They were indeed baked wid love! Baked to perfection! Loved them @Brahm Jyot SinGh
5,Thank you so much floured bake for the wonderful cupcakes ÌÄåÄÌâå¡ÌÄåâÌÄåâÌÄåâ it was too yummy and couldn't stop licking my fingers ÌÄåÄÌâå¡ÌÄåâÌÄåâÌÄåâ. You follow exact time management too . All the best ÌÄåÄÌâå¡ÌÄåâÌÄåâÌÄåâ
5,"Despite knowing Anitha for many years now, I had never tasted her dulce de leche brownies until recently. And boy, am I cross about it! These little brown wonders are easily the tastiest ones I have ever had. They are oh-so-soft, melt in your mouth, and are utterly delicious. So much so, that the dessert vanished from the lunch table much sooner than our mains. If you thought no one can eat just one applies only to your favourite bag of chips, wait until you bite into one of these! A must try for everyone who love their sweet nothings :)"
5,"Working with Anita has always been seamless, especially since i dont live in the country. I had first ordered a red velvet cake for my mom's birthday. My entire family loved the cake. The way it looked and the taste of it.So second time around for my parents 40th wedding anniversary, I decided to go to her again. She was very accommodating (considering my mom is a tad bit picky :) ) and gave the right suggestions to make the perfect cake. The cake looked absolutely gorgeous. I got a vanilla cake with a layer of vanilla icing and chocolate ganache layers in between topped with vanilla icing. My parents loved it. It looked so delicious as well."
5,"We are so glad that we chose Floured to make Customized Cupcakes for our son's bday. They were an instant hit!!! They looked n tasted equally good.Keshav/Anita, really appreciate all your efforts in arranging the toppers(as requested) and delivering on time (as the Venue was far from the city).Looking forward for more yumminess!!!"
5,Life is something to be celebrated every moment but then we would go bankrupt and hence there are celebrations that happen every now and then! And that's where Floured has played an important role in our life by making it more splendid than it is already. I have been ordering cakes from Floured from past 2 years and I am more than happy to say that the level of creativity and the deliciousness always amazed me! My nephew is also a big fan of the cake Aunty and always insists to get something from floured - this time it was mesmerising set of cup cakes !If you are looking for celebrations that remain permanently etched in your memories - you have stopped by the right place :)
5,"I have had cookies, red velvet cupcakes and pastries. All are awesomely yummy and tasty. Try once and you will ask for more and more. GO FOR IT PEOPLE !!!"
5,"the brownies and the red velvet cupcakes , these two are awesomely delicious and i order when they are coming down to Mangalore.. also not to forget the yummy plum cake during christmas.. you got to try it .."
5,Ordered a red velvet cake for my uncle on his 50th birthday & a lemon flavoured cake for my son's birthday & all of us loved it! Their lemon cake is d best lemon cake I've eaten till date!!!!The texture & the color of the cakes were too good. The toppers were excellent. Appreciate the creativity & efforts taken by them to depict even the minute details of the toppers. Would love to order from floured again.
5,"The Dulche de leche brownies, DDLB are to die for! Go get a grab if you haven't yet, you can thank me later!Sitting in Mumbai I get them delivered here with the first person I now travelling and you can never go wrong!Waiting for them to open up a branch in Mumbai!!Good luck, you guys rock!"
5,"The cakes that Floured makes are yummy. One of those rare bakers who use good quality ingredients, ensure rich taste and score full points on presentation too. You can have your cake customised for any occasion. If you get the chance, ask for their brownies and red velvet cupcakes. Once you get a taste of Floured, you ain't going elsewhere."
1,"Had Samosa at this bakery/outlet on 23rd April. Was the worst samosa I had ever had in the recent times. Outer layer of samosa was roasted while inner layer of samosa was uncooked/unbaked. Even the filling inside samosa was very bad. Took Pizza parcel for my kid who rejected it after having first bite of first piece. Curious, I tasted pizza and it was so rubbery/elastic that it was not edible. Not sure about other items though. IMO, I would avoid this place for sure for my future visits."
3.5,"Cakes are good having here...pineapple, butterscotch pastries are super...Breads cakes available here tastes good with fresh quality...perfect for parties...cheers...:)"
3.5,"Cakes & Slices are one of the popular bakeries in Bank Colony & Srinivasnagar localities. This Joint offers a wide range of pastries and bakery products at affordable prices; earlier our locality had very less bakeries serving Pastries. We generally order pastries here for any special occasion instead of going far places. The best part about this joint is maintaining the consistency in quality, taste and price. Must try dishes are Veg Puffs, Ohm Biscuits, Butter Biscuits, Khara Bread, Pineapple cake and all pastries. I strongly recommend this place!Overall:Taste: 3.5/5Ambiance: 3.75/5Quality: 3.5/5Service: 3.5/5VFM: 4/5bangaloreepicure.com"
4,"I am a frequenter of this place...  Located on the main road of Srinivasnagar, 80ft road, a little ahead of Bata Showroom and Reliance fresh, this place for sure is known to the residents there and is a popular place for the school, tuition children in the area.. It is a bakery yes but the shininess and cleanliness of this place is welcoming.. you have a couple of chairs to sit and eat your cakes,snacks :) I personally love their Vanilla pastry, strawberry pastry, Chocolate pastry.. The palya( aloo) bun, khara bun is equally good.. They used to have Pizzas,burgers which were really worth the money and tasty too but not sure if they still have it on their shelves... The Bread toasts are also a must try.. So if you are around this area and want to grab some instant bites. go straight to cakes and slices and indulge in quick,reasonable nibbling with no qualms"
4,"Undoubtedly best bakery in Srinivasnagar & Bank Colony area. I'm a sincere customer to this bakery from past 2 years. It is located opposite to Panchami on 80 feet main road between Srinivasnagar and Bank Colony bus stops.Ambiance is really cool, as soon as you enter aroma of fresh baked bread welcomes you. Its completely air conditioned floor and every thing is showcased in a great manner. They serve awesome pastries (fresh cream cakes), donuts, mousse cakes, choco lava, various kinds of puffs, rolls and chocolates. Every item is too good. It is far better compared to many popular bakery in the area like Kaggis. The price is quite low considering the quality and ambiance.I'm a big fan of their pastries and I'm ordering with them from past 2 years. Till now I haven't observed a single flaw in taste. Each time it delights me just the way it delighted me in my first visit.This bakery is highly recommended for its consistent quality!beingbakasura.com"
5,Found the restaurant while passing by on my way home.Ordered 2 Paneer Rolls and a Chicken Fried Rice.Both were tasty and fulfiling.Service was swift and the place is clean and hygienic.
5,Best shawarma roll and chicken 65 I have had in Bangalore. The roll especially was perfect. It was obvious that ingredients used were of good quality.
5,Excellent food and Service.I live in an area with not many restaurant options but this place is certainly up to the mark.Went during the lunch time with my friend and had Chicken Dum Biryani and Chicken Kolapuri.The Biryani was probably the best I have had in a long time.Chicken Kolapuri was also rich in flavour and taste.The rates seem quite reasonable for the the quality of food offered and ambience.
5,Great place just opposite to RV College of Architecture.Ordered Chicken Biryani and Chicken 65.Both were delicious!!Heard there Shawarma Rolls are good too.All the staff are courteous and the place is clean and well maintained.
1,"I have been here many times when it was located in bda to have crispy n crunchy sandwiches, but now they have shifted to another shop, at present the taste of sandwichs are pathetic, i never expected this.."
1,For once known to be serving one of the best sandwich s in Bangalore to this. The quality has gone really bad. They have increased the prices and have replaced the cheese slices with the modest portion of mayo for almost all of their sandwiches.They also cheap out in adding tomatoes or any other vegetables for chats and you actually need to tell the guy to add all that! He bluntly says he cannot. Talk about customer service.The quality and experience has really come down and I would recommend to not go there due to this experience.
3,"Place is situated on a road side, ppl allergic to pollution and dust should avoid this place. Hygiene must be improved,food is pretty good here and reasonable, egg Maggie here is my favorite"
2.5,"A small place just behind bmsce. It's damn cheap. But few might won't like its hygiene. They serve north Indian and Chinese. If you are damn low on cash and in the area, you can give a visit."
3,"Anda ka funda is place to visit to have some aloo paratha. Typical North Indian in style, this eatery has some good amount of items with eggs. A takeout by many means, the hygiene is a compromise here. Do visit if you live nearby and want to have to hot parathas."
1,I'd not suggest this place to anyone.There is absolutely no Hygiene.Place stinks & The place is run by a Couple & their year old baby.Places like this should be shut down by The Hygiene Department (If there was one in India) Before the food gives Bangalore diarrhea.Known for hostelites throwing eggs on it.
3.5,cheap and best i guess .... tasty food ... quick and friendly service ... place is a bit small ... but enough for a fast food place i guess ...
2.5,Used to go there frequently a couple of years ago. Hygiene is very poor. They have a good verity of food. The prices are dirt cheap. Last resort place I would say.
2,You will get lot of varieties in  egg and paratha. Despite having good taste there is 0% hygiene and clean.You will suffer after dinning here so please don't go here looking at its menu and eye catching price tag!!!
3.5,The place is very small . Hygiene is not properly maintained . The food provided is tasty and service is fast. But the place is dirty to have lunch . Good for less money and to have lunch alone and fast
3,It's a place for students and bachelors. Lot variety of egg items are available but you need to stand on not so clean street or be seated on plastic chairs on foot path. But a nice place if you are OK with compromise on location for taste
3,All my non veg friends only egg is available here no other animal so be prepared to have a lot of egg and hygiene is really not ok and taste is also kind of average
2.5,Its a nice n cheap place but not so hyginic.its mainly gud 4 snacks. Its a nice place to go with frnds but gets very clummsy.the bst item here u can get in my opinion r d parathas. Egg roll is also gud.bst for all age gps and with all companies.. :)2.5
1,"worst service & only money minded they will deliver old cakes please don't order fondant cake from this shop. not polite worst behavior, unprofessional"
5,Wow this food is great ???spicy pongalwith pure ghee and sweet pongal excellent and the quality is amazing.. Delivery was quite quick.ALL SHOULD TASTE.. NEVER MISS
5,The puliyogare tastes really good just like home made. It was well packed and quick delivery. Thanks to Zomato. Cleanliness is mantained. My favorite dish was corn baji it was delivered hot and spicy
5,Great authentic paatis menu! Mouth watering?Ulundohore eaten decades ago.. Yummy pongal. Waiting for the restaurant to open...Whats that corn bhajji.. Eager to taste ?
4,"Convenient and Average Prices, a neighbourhood bar for guys to get a quick drink or sit back and enjoy buddy company. I have never seen families here. It's most suitable for stag and solo parties. Good Food and fast service."
5,"Ambience is good. Best food and i loved the taste of panner ghee roast and palak panner. And budget friendly. And its my all time favourite place in bangalore. Service was good.Please provide some different kinds of brands in beers, like tuborg Carlsberg etc..,"
4,"Had been to this place recently, there is smoking and non smoking zone. They offer draught beer pitcher at 300 which is great and also the starters were good. If you want to have a pocket friendly session then you can go to this place. Ladies might feel uncomfortable with this place as it doesn't have a great ambience like that of other famous one's."
1,Worst ambience ever experienced. Poor service And food quality. Don't take a chance else regret for that. Only the name is pub but nothing near to pub it's purely a local bar. Not at all for family
3,"Visited this place after a long time, It's a two floor setup, with average ambience. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Ordered Budweiser, Chicken uruwal, Egg Pakora, Tandoori Roti, Egg masala and Chicken Kolhapuri. The food on the whole was reasonably good. Service was quick. Food is reasonably priced but charging 230/- for a bottle of Budweiser is too high when the ambience is taken into consideration."
5,"So yeah been to this place without much expectations. First impressions you will see a local bar just beside the entrance to the pub , which is really bad . ( Don't judge already )Once you enter you will understand by the ambience and aroma of the place how good it is . Two sections basically smoking and non-smoking . Smoking section is a desi one or else you can call it as a Well maintained Dhaba and the other Non smoking section ( which we just had a glimpse ) was a shady place with a descent view across . Consist of TV and other fancy things and music was perfect. .The Price here are pocket friendly , (as we saw this price list through zomato before ) we expected the food and beer to be bad ( indian bruhh ) But it wasnt that bad . Service was best actually , dint notice any one speaking English but for people who know kannada , they treat you well .Rated 5 mainly for the location and service. .Thank you."
1.5,I can say that it's the only pub near monotype which has both outdoor seating and indoor seating. Its like some local bar with dark lit indoors. The seating is just average. It is mainly for the lot of people who want to hang around with cheap liqour as they have happy hours for great friendships.They hardly have strong beers so we had a premium 1+1 pitcher and it wasn't upto the mark either. You cannot rely on the food here as it wont be any relish to the tastebuds.
1,"I had a very bad experience with K27 today. They have renovated and made the price of the beer picture to Rs.450 from Rs 325. But the worst part when i visited in d afternoon yesterday, I asked for tissue paper and the waiter gives me cut news papers like in some local bar. I asked the waiter to call the cashier/manager they never turned up, when i went to pay the bill and found and complained, he was so arrogant and dint even apologize. When i said i will write a review about this, he says do what ever you want and he is not scared. Please see the pics as well."
4,Beer is really cheap . happy hours 1+1 beer kfFood was average and chicken drumstick was nice at 130 rs. I likes the environment inside .cool and nice place to have fun .bar tender was friendly.
3,Ambience on the inside is average. Their outside sitting place is poorly planned. The stone seats don't have back rests. Service was poor as well. Prices are affordable and it's someplace you'd want to go to enjoy without ripping a hole in your pocket.
3,"Firstly,the beer is damn cheap! Cheap isn't even the word. It's as cheap as buying a ac bus ticket. So just scoot to this place when you are short on money. But but but,the service sucks. Sucks real bad. Very arrogant people out there. Food is average. Rates are again cheap when you compare it to other pubs. Ambience is okay-ish and could be much better.Overall verdict:Rates-4.5/5Taste- 3.5/5Service- 2/5"
2,"go here if you want horrible service,average tasting food and cheap beer!!yes cheap beer! a mug of kf stong draught beer costs 80 bucks and there is happy hours from 10.00 to 18.00 hours so its like 40 bucks per mug.visit this place if u are tight on the pockets!"
3,I really disappointed by this place ... It was not up to my point .. I just liked the egg fried rice ... Rest all I was very disappointed ...
2,"Nice place to hav a relaxing time with friends!! I've been there for more than dozen times! The serving is not so good there! It's the worst ever, they never respond u back in an evenly manner, but the food is good."
5,This is the best place to have Pongal in banshankri. Pongal and it's called as Tirupathi Pongal and it is served with curd raitha.. I regularly visit twice in a week..
4,"Zomato delivery was super fast and food delivered super hot inspite of the distance... The food was tasty, well packed, well prepared, correct price and above all brings a smile of satisfaction... Good job BCH.... Loved and enjoyed every bite of your food.... Will be back again soon..."
4,"being unwell I don't feel like eating anything and who wants to eat food from the hostel mess, idli was the only option. Bengaluru coffee house delivered Amazing idlis at very cheap cost, however ?30 tax was added which doubled the cost of idli. thank you to Zomato offers I got reasonable discount."
4,I like the coffee here ... the masala dosa is good !ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a bit crowded in the evenings.but a really nice place to stop by and enjoy some good coffee.The chaats arenÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât great
5,"Food here is very well priced. They serve a lot of items - chaats, South Indian and Chinese food here as well. Tried Gobi Manchurian, fried rice, kesari bhath and neer dosa. Taste of all of them is pretty good. Service here is usually fast. They accept paytm as payment method as well."
3.5,I vist here almost every day as it's close to my office! As mentioned above the service has to be improved a lot. and the taste never remain constant. too too slow people. If the coffee is light when asked they make it strong thats not and issue.
1,"I was tempted to go in, with the assumption that this might be the next hotspot for hot idly and shtrong filter kaapi. I was sadly mistaken. I could barely complete the plate of idly I took and the coffee tasted very light.Not at all good! Avoid!!!"
4.5,"Had a conversation with the cashier who was more than happy to spill the beans on the coffee bytes story. I mentioned that it had garnered poor reviews online and he told that the head cook was changed recently.In complete contrast to the opinions given so far, the idli was good today. We were a group of 5 and all of us would definitely recommend the masala dosa. The sagu needs some work. Chutney is good. A good place to spend time with friends."
3,"Coffee Bytes is the newly opened quick breakfast joint in Hanumanthanagar. I happened to visit here within 15 days after they opened. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a self-service joint with limited breakfast menu which includes Idly Vada, Kharabath, Kesari bath and Coffee.In recent times, there are so many joints opened like Coffee Bytes and food is brilliant. But here everything has to be improved. Idly was totally taut where the Vada was lack of crispiness. Kharabath was bland too!Folks at Counter are bit arrogant and service is slow. Place is nicely maintained with decent dÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå©cor! Food is decently priced and one of the value for money joints for the south Indian breakfast.Overall:Taste: 2.5/5Quality: 3/5Ambiance: 3.5/5VFM: 3.75/5Service: 2.5/5bangaloreepicure.com"
1,Can't go Lower than thisOne of the dirtiest place that could serve foodAbsolutely no hygieneBad tasteWorst staffOne person cooking everythingNot recommend at allTry on your own risk
4,"I visit this place regularly after office hours. You get stomach filling sandwich for 40-50 rupees. They have amazing milkshakes and their KitKat Mikshake is worth trying. Place is really small so you will have to stand and eat so that is a bummer. But good, tasty and stomach filling food for less price.theroaminggastronomer.wordpress.com"
3.5,"It's a food court with so many tiny food joints! It's become popular in BSK now. I had been here a couple of times and loved the Sandwiches, dry chats & Twistato especially. The prices are pocket friendly! One single place to savour multiple dishes from multiple joints! Recommended place?bangaloreepicure.com"
2.5,"This new shop is aimed at those wanting a quick snack light on the pocket. Definitely the target group is the students around BSK BDA Complex. It comes to life (like many other foodie places in the area) in the evenings with a limited range during the day.The potato-on-a-stick seems to be its USP but I have not tried that. The veg sandwich was grilled well and had plenty of fresh salad veggies when I bought it the first time. However, the quality of its fare is not consistent. The chaats especially are disappointing. The counter has some nicely-wrapped chocolates in a wide variety of flavours, which are good though they can be more reasonably priced. Seating is a couple of chairs outside and sitting inside is cramped."
3,"The Tea here is really good, especially the ginger tea and ginger lemon tea, and they make it better than the nearby SLV or nandini. Cannot vouch the same for their coffee though. Remember to ask for nominal sugar in the tea as they have a tendency to make it sweeter than required. They have 51 variety of teas, and some of them are quite unique. Coming to the food, the place is not exactly up to mark. Chaats are ok, not so great. Some items like samosa and aloo tikki seem to be stale. I like the gulab jamun which is available occasionally, and is usually fresh. The place is near BDA Complex and gets a lot of crowd in the evening. The outlet is cramped with too many counters trying to sell several items in a very small space. The seating isn't sufficient, and the seats inside give a claustrophobic feeling. The outdoor seating is still better inspite of the traffic and noise."
4,"Well well.. Sandwiches, chats, Burgers, variety of teas, juices.. all in one place ?probably the only place which has it all.. One stop.. This is opposite Jalsa, on the same lane as SLV Swadishta The place looked quite clean and the menu sheets are sorted out so well.. I was so full when I entered here and gotta try only Kodbale masala..  It was a tad spicy but perfect for an evening snack.. yes they have boti masala, nippat masala, moong dal masala and the sorts... Chats are on one section, the twistatos on the other side... Prices are really reasonable..  you have a seating section too inside with a few tablesI would definitely go back to this place to try out more varieties.. But I strongly suggest this place for all the nearby folks to try this new place"
4,"It's a chat place where we can find different types of chats at one place.... It has diff menu cards also...Here we can see some famous chats lik bangarpet pani puri , hindupur Sandwich, malnadu cofee/tea n vadapavs, fritato, juices n so many r available at one spot...We tasted peri peri fritato n bangarpet pani puri n some 2 in 1 masala which includes floating n masala puri is si yumm. ..."
1,"They have various Cornetto cones priced at 30,40,45,55,65...etc...but there's only one option to take the Cornetto cones, why is this so? If ur not placing the things u wanna sell properly, what's the point of putting up the menu? Make sure theres a section of Cornetto cones with its price variations"
2,"not up to the mark, by the time it arrived was melted"
1,I haven't received the order.
2,The service and the ambience was good. But their softie cone (soft serve) was like made with water and flavoring. Cheapest quality ice cream I ever tasted. I don't know if it was the softie machine's fault or of their ice cream brand. I personally like burger king's softie and it is way cheaper(18rs or something).
2,"The first time i visited Kwality Walls, i straight away wanted to try something new and that was  Chill Grill (choose your flavors and the ice cream in beaten up on ice sheet marble and served in a cup) I chose 'Tutti Fruti  and Fruit & Nut"", which were creamilicious. Sometime later, I ordered the same two and they did not taste anything like before. Their Swirls are not my favorite, McD has better ones! The poor rating goes to the way the place is handled. Firstly, the place is always empty . Secondly the staff is rude, moody and unprofessional, sometimes unhygienic too. Third, the TV is always on and the staff are the only ones who watch it. They are least bothered about customers. It's located in such a prime area and they have such good space, but i feel its being wasted. Why is the management so ignorant and not doing anything about it; despite poor rating for all 3 outlets."
2,"Stinking horrible place.. Can hardly see anyone there.. On my first visit I ordered and was waiting for delivery, for which it never received the product. Questioned him and repeated the order again yet never received, just waste of time waiting there... My wife had been there with our kid, lucky she got the order ice cream and landed with stomach upset.."
4.5,nice place to hang out with friends ... always liked this place ... and the ice cream is really good and tasty on par with the likes of baskin robbins and swensens from our domestic company ..... they maintain good hygiene and quality
1.5,"This was my 1st visit to this branch, terrible experience from the guy who prepares. Firstly he is not familiar with Kannada or English. So communication issues. Next, we ordered Cornetto Fresh fruit, he gave it very quickly. But it had nothing but only some ice cream and very few pomegranates. According to the menu, it says Swirl, Strawberry and Choco biscuits in the tip. But this guy never replied for watever we asked which was not there in the swirl. Fresh fruit swril is famous for Strawberry, which is not a seasonal fruit, its available all time. Very bad. Never expected this kinda service. #kwalitywalls address this please."
3.5,"People have mixed feelings about this place. As per me, Kwality Walls is still a best along with other Ice Cream Brands. I had my first Choco Bar from Kwality Walls only. Well, The Kwality Wall's Swirls in BSK look like a flagship outlet with pretty decent interiors. I love their Strawberry, Butterscotch & Kesar Pista at any point of time. They have umbrella chairs & bean bags outside & inside. They should probably work on pricing part, since the prices are too expensive. I recommend this place!bangaloreepicure.com"
2.5,"This place is located in a corner, off Banashankari BDA complex. Nice little place, with a pleasing ambience (with tables under an umbrella on the outside). They provide quick service too.Now coming to the ice creams themselves, they're quite disappointing. They do not even compare to other popular parlours like Corner House or Baskin Robbins. The prices though, still remain 'premium', as always.Not really worth visiting.Food - 1/5Ambiance - 3/5Service - 4/5Value for money - 1.5/5Hygiene - 3/5Overall - 2.5/5"
4.5,Had the best Kesar pista ice cream. Never expected this quality from Kwality walls. Heard the swirls to be their signature to be my next cone to dive in.
2.5,A good place to hang out and spend sometime but the ice creams does not compliment.. Nothing admirable in the likes of great chains of ice cream parlours in Bangalore..
1.5,"More ""ice"" than ""cream"".The problem with Kwality Walls is that firstly, it doesn't even contain the minimum quantity of milk to be called ice cream and it is rather slyly labeled as a "" frozen dessert "".Nowhere on the carton do they mention the words "" ice cream"". It mainly consists of hydrogenated vegetable oil, water and a small about of dehydrated milk.. Which is an utter disappointment.I believe only in Naturals, Corner House and Baskin Robins do you get good quality ice cream that doesn't leave you bloated because of the hydrogenated oils.I had ordered a chocolate milkshake which tasted watered down and not at all worth the money they charged.Service was fine. Ambience is good, too. Hence the extra 0.5 stars. Although, I am extremely disappointed with the quality of their food."
3,Nice serveBut there is no different varieties were u can choose the goodI had some problem wit the menuDnt get the best of itchange the menu nd start trying new thingsI think the menu 2 years ago was the best
1,"Absolutely DISGUSTING.....FOOD, FLAVOUR, AMBIENCE, TASTE , INGREDIENTS USED is BELOW EXPECTATIONS.... Absolutely unreliable place to dine.....chances of FOOD POISONING IS VERY HIGH!!!"
5,"A weekend kitchen break from your daily routine!Delicious South indian breakfasts served at very reasonable rates, and an all brahmin set up.Visit Ruchi Maayaka for the best home made foods, and also don't forget to leave a review!"
5,"Yummiee weekend breakfast ... Awesome taste ... Roasted paddus with pudina chutney is awesome.. Anyone in & around padmanabha nagar , must try this .. Kudos #team RM ..."
5,Excellent sandwich so much underrated and very friendly environment juices are good with fresh fruits. Try the mushroom cheese sandwich it's bang for the buck
4,This tiny mess near kathriguppe signal packs a punch when it comes to Andhra meals... They serve hot meals with tasty PAPPU (dhal with spinach) and ghee ...it waters Ur mouth right ?? ? They also serve non vegetarian like briyani and methi chicken..
5,This has become my go to place now for lunch. The Andhra meals that they provide are to die for. Biriyani is also superb. But the standout performer for me is the Sholay kabab. It is perfectly spiced with a tangy twist in the mouth. Looks droolworthy as well
3,This our go to place for food in Banashankari. Any time this restaurant is busy and the food quality is maintained. We have tried almost all dishes here. Affordable by everyone. Service is quick. Team management is awesome across the floors. Self service. From morning breakfast to dinner you can choose this place. Even we have ordered online also. The packing good and leakproof until it reaches home.
3,"An ideal place for a quick bite. Udupi foods served quick, is their USP. There are two sections, a self-service wing on the ground floor and an AC service hall on first floor.I like the idly vada, dosa items, and filter coffee for breakfast. Thali is best for lunch and dinner, especially when you are in a hurry.North Indian Rotis and palav are also available, but i have not tried it.The only reason I am giving a 3 star rating is because the food is average, nothing outstanding in taste nor is it bad, it's just about average, clean, good food and on budget."
3,Decent place for a quick bite. Nothing great. Food taste is just ok. Might get crowded on weekends. They also offer unlimited meals for Rs 150.
3,Tried their south Indian Thali. Dint like the taste. Ambience ok.Cleanliness has to be improved.Pricing is ok. Taste not that great.Service is ok.
1,This place has unlimited lunch for Rs150This lunch is wasteThe taste is very badAnd quality of food is badThe hotel need to improve the quality of food
1,"Worst falooda of my life till date. To start with it was kulfi falooda and there was no kulfi what was in there was water frozen with flavour of kulfi there was no cream no dry fruits nothing close to a original kulfi.It was rare to find falooda in it, ok amount of chia seeds little tuti fruti at the bottom.It was not even sweet I have to add ruafza to make it edible.Overall people just avoid and don't dare to try falooda of this place. Previously we have tried there stick kulfi that was also not good and we have to throw that after few bites. I think this place is not for sweets. My search for good falooda still continue..."
3,"Ordered the masala dosa from Anna Kuteera, didn't seem or taste too great. Overall it lacked something and am not able to pinpoint exactly what. Have heard that the meals here is great, have to go one day to try that out and maybe then my rating would change"
3,I visit this place most often with my friends.. This is a budget restaurant and always choose the rooftop.. The dishes served here are good..
4,What I love about this place is the food although it doesn't have much space inside! Their chicken appetizers are great.. the fried rice and biryani served here also delicious!
4,"Nice restaurant for south indian snacks and dose. Good chats but quantity is less. We tried Mangaluru bonda, chats and coffee. Quick preparation of food (self service)."
4,This is just opposite to our house and we have been there more than 20 times.Liked their Idly vada set dosas and Masala dosas. Tried Poori and chaat also.Liked all dishes. But manchow soup was not Good. Channa Batura was.nice. Their south Indian Thali is nice and very reasonable.Prices are affordable. Bought oarcel roti and Panner Masala..it was good. As its jump its a Saviour joint for us.
3,"Had got a coffee and Rava Idli, Rava idli was very soft and fresh, it came with a potato saagu and a Chutney both being very good. Coffee was great as well! However they can improve on their aesthetics near the juice/sweets section as it looked a bit shabby, apart from it everything was pretty neat.Looking forward to try other dishes."
3,"Food taste is goodThe service is not so goodThey take too much time for serving even when the crowd is lessFood is over priced for the quality, quantity and taste for the food that is served"
3,"Had been here with family for an evening dinner, the ambience resembles that  of UD chain, but is certainly lot more spacious, we went to the service hall on first floor, ground floor has self-service.We ordered the following items - French fries, Gobi Manchurian, Plain Dosa, Set Dosa, Rava Idly.Except for Gobi Manchurian everything else was prepared well and tasted good, gobi manchurian  didn't feel fresh and was bit hard.Pricing is very reasonable and service is very good as well."
5,"This place has never disappointed me till Now! I really like their chaats, always crispy, tasty and enjoyable.Quick Service and value for money place."
4,"Been to the darshini section on ground floor. They have service on 1st floor. Place is clean and crowd is good. Ordered idli, vada, masala dosa and coffee. Masala dosa was good yet expensive. Coffee needs a lot of improvement. Will surely drop by to try their north Indian stuff on 1st floor soon. VFM 4 on 5, taste 4 on 5, ambience 5 on 5, Service 5 on 5. A really good addition to Jayanagar area. Try it!"
5,So was in the mood for veggie delights and stopped by the place for some dosa... I was taken aback by the mouth watering dosas these guys make.. really loved it.. you have to stop by if you're in the neighborhood to try this.. ?
3,Food - 3.0/5Ambience - 2.0/5Service - 3.0/5Can Try - Mughlai Biryani.Clue - Vegetarian North Indian gravies and starters were okay . Not too oily which is a plus. But taste and quality of Rotis can be improved.
1,Food is not good... Noodles were smelling like its was prepared 2 days before...bad smelling.. I throwed it.. Food is not good please give fresh food
1,No salt
5,Super
4,GoodGood
2,wrong order was placed
2,taste want to improve
1,poor quality no taste i ll go with swiggy they will supply quality and hot food
4,Very good
5,"nice , koot is good"
1,paneer not good
1,"Rude staff. The attitude is terrible. Moreover the owner enterains such crude behaviour. Can't expect high standards from a small restaurant. But, this is extremely pathetic."
4,I ve been visiting this hotel since 8years it is best for breakfast and dinner the taste of vada and onion dasa will be very good and it is best place to have ur breakfast
4,I actually checked into Udupi Upahar in Nagawara area right after Manyata Tech park on left hand side if coming from hebbal.I am not sure this one here and Nagawara branch is related.The food quality is top notch. It is very fresh.Most importantly i noticed that the kitchen is kept very clean.If you are passing by this area or live nearby i would highly recommend that you try breakfast or lunch here. You will thoroughly enjoy the restaurant for its freshness and cleaniness inspite of being right by the road.It is right next to overbridge right after Manyata tech park on left side.
5,At first form childhood onwards I won't like idli. I don't like the taste of idli. When I came to Bangalore then my sister forced to eat idli vada. That is the first time I loved that idli. Up to now I was eating idli there only
2.5,"Best outlet for fast and ready food. You can find service hall upstairs. You will get Breakfast, lunch and dinner but as far as I know service hall opens at noon. Its just opposite to bank colony bus stop."
3,"I'm the last person to judge south indian food. However, they seemed to be doing great business which was an indicator that they do what they do best. We tried their masala dosa and though there's little to innovate on that front, it was good and fulfilling."
4,This is perfect place for breakfast and lunch...uthapam and idly are very good...Gobi Manchuria will be the best you can here....cheers...:)
4,"This darshini is located behind Bank Colony Bus stop towards Magestic. Dishes are good. However, I prefer chaats over other dishes here. Bit crowdy at times but serves my purpose when I need have quick breakfast or a chaat."
3,"It's just a OKAY kind of hotel. I'm visiting this hotel occasionally from past 4 years, nothing has been changed. Neither the interior nor the taste. It has a small self service wing and a medium sized service wing. Kitchen is not so big and hygiene has not maintained well. I ordered paper masal dosa and vada... Both were just above average. It can be an alternative if you are out of options.beingbakasura.com"
3.5,This restaurant is located in Bank Colony circle and the best quick breakfast and lunch place... The dishes are very nice compare to other darshani's in this locality...Just like other restaurants they have service and self service too..Price is affordable and Value for money..Decent service area..This restaurant is filled with bachelors and students all the time...Authentic dal and Gobi Chilly is really good and must tryOverall:Quality: 3.5/5Taste: 4/5Ambiance: 3/5VFM: 3.5/5bangaloreepicure.com
3.5,"Consists of a fast food and a service section.. this restaurant is a popular one among the Srinagar residents ..easy to locate.. on the main eighty feet roadI love the North Indian meals here..  the pricing is reasonable..consists of rotis , two subzis  and dalPulao, curd rice,salad ,soup,papad and a sweetWe had ordered extra sides i.e. Paneer butter masala which had the paneer,butter and the masala giving us the individual flavors in literal senses  :) If you are in for a good deal for your pockets and also a good taste at the same time.. Srinagar Udupi Upahar should be your choice"
5,Good place for quick eat. Dosas and idli are favourites
2.5,Okay okay!
4,Cheap n best. Not a luxury hotel but the food is good and affordable and worth. Pure veg hotel which serves both south n north Indian dishes. Parking 4wheeler is a concern as its situated in bank colony junction.
2,"Ordinary!We had been here for lunch today. The place is stuffy and not ventilated.It was sweet corn soup, chicken 65, mushroom masala and some butter kulchas that we ordered. Sweet corn was on average, but I felt the sweet corn was too old. The chicken 65 masala was a bit raw and sour. The mushrooms in mushroom masala werenÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât fresh! Kulchas were edible."
3,Ordered paneer roll through zomato through these guys. Well I wouldn't say I was completely satisfied n neither would I say I was dissatisfied. Just a feeling of could have been better. Paneer was soft n nice n the paratha was aptly cooked. I kind of felt let down by the filling. May be the masala. This has a tangy taste which is good but not as good as the red masala. I had requested the to make it spicy n it wasn't. Overall it was an average fare n not much to complain about. Like I said earlier this could have been lot better. Might order other rolls in the future..
4,Great place to have fried rice and rolls at a reasonable place. Quick to serve and take away. No place to sit and devour the dish. But always a nice place to visit for takeaway
4,"So recently during my one, industrial visit in Bangalore. I ordered food from box 8 outlet there. Same quality and standard taste was quite good as always as what I usually have in Mumbai. Box 8 is one of my favorite foodchain, which I usually prefer whenever I crave for indian foods & curries.Food I ordered:-Kadhai paneer:- It was good l, the paneer was tender and nice gravy, you can have it with rice as well indian breads.Dal makhani:- I love it having with rice specially, It was perfect.Paneer makhani:- I would highly recommend this, it had good texture and thick gravy. The taste was also very perfect must try.Fusion box:- paneer masala fusion box, it ia quite fulfilling and satiating. Do try this out.Veggie delight sandwich:- box8 sandwiches are really good too, their moist bread and inside fillings was very yummy & fresh.Enjoyed the food!!"
1,Very bad service as there is no response to order placed and also they take more than 90 mins to deliver.. sorry not a good experienceTheir call centre people can speak broken English. I am not sure how people may order in the near future with this kind of experience
4,"KFC chicken yummy as always, where ever we go same taste and lovely ambience..One of my favourite place to have chicken..I took chicken longer and chicken popcorn it was so yummy and delicious as always.."
3,Food - 8/10Service - 7/10Ambience - 9As rest of the KFC's they have maintained their quality up to the mark. Ambience is well lit and clean. Staffs are cooperative but a bit slow in service.
1,Not a good place. Overrated items. I ordered potato twister which was half baked and over priced. Not good ambience also. I don't recommend u this place for sure.
4,This place is the best for ice cream lovers. We ordered banana caramel and blueberry ice cream rolls. They provided the ice cream rolls with wafers. The ice cream was so pleasing but the quantity needs to be improved. You can try out the ice cream rolls once. I didn't find any difference between ice cream and ice cream rolls tho. ambience is quite decent.
3,"Just about average. The beating of icecream into thin sheets and rolling them sounds exciting but does nothing to the taste. It is just that - a rolled up ice cream. Ordered lychee rush and nutty kulfi. Liked lychee but I was given a shot glass filled with milk to go with the ice cream which is a total mismatch according to me. Nutty Kulfi mentioned kesar kulfi chunks but I couldn't see any. I really think with so many extraordinary ice cream parlours coming up in Bangalore everyday, Roll Over needs to change its game to keep up!"
3,"2-3 times i have been there..try DEATH BY CHOCOLATE ,RED VELVET,BUTTERSCOTCH and NUTTY KULFI..all flavours are good only ...ambience - nicestaff- good"
3,Good place to have ice cream.Went there again and tried filter kapi this time.it is good with the perfect taste of coffee.had good dessert there.
3,Liked the concept of the way they make ice cream! 3 stars as quantity is less for the price! Place is not that big to fit in crowd. Will definitely visit once again for the DBC icecream and Pan magic ice cream rolls which are quite famous ?
4,I tried their signature desert which is chocolate karma n it was really a chocolate karma?? just loved the taste of it. One should really try this out it will leave a memory on your taste buds.
3,Tried the Devil's Chocolate one. Good enough for 2 people. Ice cream tasted good. The chocolate sauce as a accompaniment was cool! Ambiance is really good in this place.
4,"Was craving for some basic ice cream so had,1. Choco chip overload : Basic rolled up Chocolate ice cream with Choco chips and Chocolate syrup. Wasnt too Chocolate-y and tasted YUMM!2. Hot chocolate fudge : I wanted to have vanilla ice cream for some reason, so asked for the vanilla with Chocolate syrup all over it.I've tried most of their ice creams , so going to basics was something new :)"
5,"A good place to have icecreams , They different variety of new flavours like chilly gauva nd stuff must try after a good dinner at jaynagar . Its beside anand sweet nearest land mark."
4,Just as roll over the ice cream .Concept was great.Ambience was k.Service is good.Parking is an issue.Recommended for their seasonal special.
2,"Easy to locateAmbience 2/5Service 1/5VFM 3/5Taste 3/5Hygiene 1/5Food was average, not worthBut the service, hygiene and ambience are worse!!"
3,"So it was 1 in the night! And we all bangalorians know that there are two famous restaurants open till 2 and we found imperial and had to rush in as it was there closing time! They were polite enough to let us in and took our orders - chicken fried rice, chicken noodles, panner butter masala, butter naan, prawns fried rice. The food was average. Felt it would have been little better if they had served the food hot"
5,"Well im surprised about all the negative reviews written about the restaurant. As my experience with restaurant was very different. The delay in delivery may be there various reason can't blame restaurant for that. Coming to food had ordered biriyani rice. Quantity,quality and taste was really gud. Would definitely order again here."
3,"Lassi's are something that are not made everywhere, might be better than other outlets but not the same as the Lassi we get in iconic outlets, its just one of the outlet of a big chain"
2,I ordered for a Nutella Brownie Ice-cream and was really disappointed !!!!The Brownie that they gave was a normal 'plum cake' with the resin and all (like srsly?! ?)And the Nutella was concentrated to one side which made it really sweet at that side.And the Ice-cream was as much a teaspoon.?All of which became a huge mess !!!Peace.
2,"Definitely not recommended for biryani or kabab,though the quantity was good,the taste or the smell nothing felt like atleast close to good, I'm not trying this restaurant again"
3,Ordered chicken kabab.It was overpriced as per the quantity and quality.Had high expectations but was average.Had to wait one hour to get it delivered
2,You are giving tandoori without any dip?! What nonsense
1,Very bad service.They are cheaters.They do not deliver food correctly.The show so much attitude with customers.Please dont order any food from this hotel.
3,In the lunch time I had ordered one tandoori chicken it's quite okayish not that great they can improve.I hope they will improve on this...
1,Very Pathetic Service in terms of Quantity.. I ordered for Paneer Manchurian and Got a small packet of about 8-10 pieces(about 100 grams) of Paneer. Thats it. The Bill comes to Rs.105
4,Nice food quality is good quantity is
4,tried it first time... liked it ....
5,This visit I tried their lemon chicken rolls....the succulent chicken and the hint of lemon in it simply melt in your mouth....the flavors leave a lasting impression and are yet mild and light....absolute value for money...must try rolls...
5,Packing is neat.. Thank you.. Add a spoon nxt time
2,The chicken pieces in the Butter Chicken were very under-cooked. And this isn't the first time. I really think they'd have to really improve their methods if they want to retain their customers.
1,I had ordered 6 rumali rotis but got only 5
2,it was extremely roasted
5,The service is great
2,I have not eaten the roll it was full of dust it was not packed
5,"I ordered a crispy chicken biryani, which was good. wud have been great if it was steaming hot, but knowing that the food takes about 30 mins to get delivered, it's excusable. packaging could have been better, but nothing to really complain about. All in all, I enjoyed my dinner.? Thnx wahab"
1,It was shit. uncooked..
3,average

2,Food was not that good as expected
3,food is little salty
3,packaging wasn't good.
4,"The food was amazing, the chicken biryani tasted like authentic shadi ka biryani, the chicken tikka was beautifully marinated.However the service was not at all good, the onions served with the tikka were stale and the place does not have very good ventilation and the smoke gets accumulated in the dining area. Giving 4 star rating for the taste!!"
5,On time... Delicious...
5,Ordered Malai kofta from Ubereats must say its worth the money spent and I would say it's one of the best malai kofta I've had in Bangalore..

5,Very yummy food nice quality and the quantity of the food is amazing !!! Prefer going with family and friends ? Specially the non veg items are delicious and the chicken gravy is really refreshing.

4.5,"A very pocket friendly place with great taste of food. Really loved the rolls, IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâd ordered for. Also, good service and the place is worth the time and money spent."
5,Amazing food for a great price and stands up on quality and quantity of the food and very friendly service great place to take your family out even when you're low on your budget
3,not expect ed taste
2,"I had ordered ghee rice, but what I received was like white plane rice.. Not like ghee rice.. N chicken biriyani had 2 smallest pieces jus for name sake.. To say it's chicken biriyani"
5,Homely food. Hygenic food and worth of money. Suggest to try once if possible as it is worth of money with a good taste and hygenic food which is Homely
1,"I am ordered ghee rice and roti and dhall fry bt i got white rice and dhaal curry, quantity of the curry is also be small... Very bad service"
5,"I really loved the food here. The biryani was super tasty. But apart from the food,the ambience was beautiful. It looked like I was having food in my home???"
4,"Always passing by Basavangudi I used to see this BC, I visited them last Friday and had biryani. Their biryani is really Bangalore Shaadi style. Too tasty. I don't know why they don't serve mutton biryani. I was surprised to see their menu bheja masala, katakat, leg soup etc. Will definitely visit them to have some traditional home made food."
5,"Friday biryani is too good! Only problem is u have to wait for 30mins to get a seat, but it's worth waiting, maglis sitting on the floor is also a very nice idea...must try restaurant??"
5,"Visited their restaurant had brain pepper masala, chapati and ghee rice.. Nice ambiance and hygienic food. Their menu is really exciting from paya, sheep head, mutton chops, shami kabab, etc makes u visit frequently"
4,"Today we ordered lunch it was Very delicious ND hygenic food, felt like eating home foodKeep it up guys , ooowwwsssooommmeee , we will try some other dishes also"
1,Worst biriyani I ever had. chicken in the biriyani is not cooked well chicken is very stinky chicken is very old any one can easily make it chicken is kept in refrigerator for long time. I am biriyani lover after this biriyani i forgot biriyani taste.
4.5,Just one word AWESOME... kabab i can say the best ive tasted....biryani nothing less than a megana or shivaji... very limited items and limited space... but no match to the taste... not ideal for ladies but give a try with a takeover... wil make u taste again... prefer mutton biryani over chicken... its located behind satellite bus stop...
4,"I haven't visited this place, but have ordered their food a lot of times from Zomato . The quantity they deliver is good and so is the taste. Do try the pork dishes that they have, they are mouth watering and delicious.I would definitely consider ordering more deliveries from this place."
5,"Canton here food is too good , I tried chicken biryani, egg noodles, fish curry with steam rice wow ; still I remember the taste.. excellent service and normal ambience nothing to say about it.. I love the biryani and fish curry ? it's located in main road? easily we find out this place and love to visit this place again ?"
1,ordered something .. arrived other thing
5,this sweets really good for health. more helpful to health watchers & weight watchers. that lemon ginger squash more helps to weight watchers. these sweets is low calories also. enjoy without guilt ;)
5,I've been binging on their chilli cheese maagi since I don't even remember. The staff is extremely courteous and put their best foot forward. Absolute looooove to the place and staff.
5,This sleepy galli hosts one of the awesomest sandwich walas in town. Must try herbs wala burger and the basic sandwich. Next hog is interesting Maggi fusion on the menu ?
4,Really like the salsa and nachos here. Their five pepper sanwich was pretty good and spicy too. The regular size of sanwich might be a bit small. It's a great budget friendly place although it's a tiny shop.
5,"A great place is Jayanagar for Maggi and cruncy snacks.Place is on main road but being a small shop, you might end up missing it.They offer varieties of Maggi and every one of them is wonderful. We ordered Nutella Banana Sandwich, Shikanji, nachos Chaat.Service is really friendly and they help you choose the best dishes.Must visit place"
4.5,Small cozy place. Very friendly owners.They suggested us to have maggi here.So we had -Chilli cheese maggi (4.5/5) Pretty cheesyHerb cheese burger - (4.5/5)Excellent value for money place!
4,"This small kitchen is every Maggie lovers go to place . They have a lot of options to choose from various kinds of menu . They also do serve sandwiches , wraps, dessert sandwiches . The owners are a sweet couple who are very passionate about their food dream n serving pple some delicious food . They have decorated the place with quite some cute stuff which catches attention. Will definitely recommend if you are in for a quick n delicious snack ."
5,"Best place for variety of Maggie,well everything is perfect over here. I incidentally find this place,itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a small place but super tasty snacks.They are proving hand bitten coffee.....whooo which is heaven for coffee ?? lover.?. I will definitely recommend this place."
5,This is the tiny place good food comes out ofthe noodles are absolutely delicious and so are the sandwiches My favourite  is aglio-olio with macaroni pasta it's very yummy Definitely must visit if you are in Jayanagar
5,Though the place is very small..And very limited seats...They prepare a different taste of food.....We ordered 2 types of maggi...Garlic mushroom maggi and The very spicy american Habanero maggi....Both wer at its best....iv never tasted this type anywhere as im a maggi lover......A must visit place....?
5,"This cozy, tiny place is located in Jayanagar 4th Block. We ordered a Nachos Chat and Butter Garlic Maggi. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs brilliant that they could come out with a Chat from NACHOS and itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs simply amazing! Coming to Butter garlic noodles ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ Butter and Garlic is so rightly mixed and gives a brilliant flavour, the aroma of this hits you. The owners are very courteous, really nice people who used to run Food Truck earlier and so ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâBlue WagonÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ gets its name. I must say that they are the people who inspire and showcase ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâHARDWORK NEVER FAILSÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ. Blue Wagon is Pocket Friendly Place and need to go to try some of their other Dishes ?. Please count me in as your Regular Customer."
5,"As a food explorer, every now and then I come across a place, that just floors me. The blue wagon - kitchen, did that and more. Every item ordered, was excellent. Butter garlic noodles, chilli cheese noodles, veg pizza, juicy veg sandwich, chocolate oreo shake, all already popular items for this place and all rightly popular! Just yum! The flavours were just brilliant, everything rightly done, nothing over the top, just perfect. The place is very tiny, but I think it makes the whole experience cozy, with the lovely music and creative decor. And because the place is compact, all aromas coming from the kitchen hit you! And boy did I enjoy that! And, I am editing the review since I forgot this important bit - the pricing is as reasonable as it can possibly get, had all the above mentioned items for a total of 400 Inr/-. Absolutely and strongly recommended!"
5,"Loved this place, The taste is too good. Very cosy place. The Chill cheese Maggie was damn good. The Pizzas were good too. Pocket friendly place where one can keep visiting."
4,"DonÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât judge a book by its covers - the place serves amazing food and the ambience is good with very friendly staff?.We ordered nacho chat - crispy nachos topped with fresh cut veggies ,perfect balance of acidity which gives the extra punch to the flavour profile.Next we ordered the jalapeÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå±o popper- cheesy sandwich with jalapeÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå±o bits ???."
4,Wifi:NoAmbiance:7/10Taste-o-meter:8/10Service:7.5/10Ordered for:Cheese chilli maggie:Maggie was really yummy as it had cheese and then the spicy taste was really amazing.5 pepper cheese sandwich:Sandwich also had lots of cheese and and I could feel the cheese getting melted.I really want to visit this outlet and try their other dishes.
3,"This cute little place in jayangar.it has amazing butter garlic maggi-must have!Jalepino chilli potato was okay,not that great..Garlic breads were nice.But if you are really looking for some good maggi this place is a must visit.The only thing they can improve is increase their area as it cant accommodate a group of 5-6."
4,In love with this place!! ?I have heard so much about this place and it was in my wish list for quite a long time..Tried cottage cheese sandwich and guess what it was yummylicious..?I will definitely go back again to try their maggi and other items in the menu?Pocket friendly and highly recommended??
5,"Great things come in small packages holds perfect for this place. Our search for best Maggi in Bangalore ended us in this place and we had best time in drizzling weather. We ordered for chilli cheese maggi, butter garlic Maggi along with hot coffee which was made with perfection. Garlic cheese bread is also excellent. An immaculate eating area with interiors adding to its beauty. Highly recommend the place."
4,"A good cafe serving south indian snacks and of course Desi Chinese. If you're lucky, you'll get a seat. We ordered Baby Corn Manchurian, Vada Sambar, Pakoda. Manchurian and Vada were good. Pakoda was OK."
4,"The noodles , schewan fried rice , veg fried rice and the Gobi Manchurian, everything had here was good and really liked the taste.. I am surely gonna be a repeated one here"
3,"Had ordered fried rice , gobi manchurian , schezwan fried rice , it was really good and I felt itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs worth the money, the food was sumptuous and delicious."
4,The number of good restaurants and hangout places in and around Jayanagar has increased drastically over the last couple of years and this place is one amongst them to pop up. This is a veg exclusive Asian cuisine(a perfect oxymoron don't you think??) but the food is pretty good. Both the starters and main course hit the right spot on the taste buds. Coming to the beverages the mojito can be better.My reviewFood 3.5/5Ambience 4/5Service 4/5Price for 2 1000-1200
3,"Nice places in terms of Ambiance but the food was alright, nothing that great. The stir fried flat noodles and the Thai green curry were nice. The Vietnamese coffee was also pretty good. The Vietnamese 5 spice curry had an Indian taste to it.Ambiance 4/5Food 3/5Service 4/5"
3,A small cafe which serves Veg Asian food. The soup and starters were excellent. The main course had nothing extraordinary. The beverages weren't worth the try. Definitely better places for Asian food
4,"Nice ambiance, service and great food. Taste wise it was a little bland for my pallet. But they serve huge portion size. The soup was really good. Their hakka noodles was a little too dry and cannot be eaten without a gravy. Taste wise it's good."
3,"A vegetarian Vietnamese place tucked away in 4th block. This is run by the same owners of Hanoi in Koramangala, however the restaurants are miles apart in terms of food. While the ambience is top class, and you'll always find this place overcrowded, the food could be better.What we ordered today - - Half moon dumplings : the outer layer was too thick and the stuffing lacked salt. However, the dipping sauce was awesome! - Bun Nuoc : Had good flavour ( like manchow soup) but the soup itself is too much for the amount of veggies and vermicelli - Vegetable fried rice : as good as normal steamed rice - Veggies in soy basil sauce : average. Must note the ratio of gravy to rice is very less.Tip : ask for their chilli sauce to add to the dishes to bring back the flavour"
3,"My new favourite Asian cuisine restaurant in Jayanagar! Perfect menu.But one con - pricey.I have thoroughly enjoyed the virgin pina colada, glass noodles, fried rice, baby corn manchurian here. Also the simple yet classy ambiance.Then why 3? When I came to the dessert, the fruit in it, the apple had the sticker on!!!! Unacceptable. The management did apologise and offered a replacement. But we were halfway through the dessert and did not really have the mood to give the dessert another try. Who knew if the apples would come washed or not?"
4,This was a home delivery order. Had some honey chilli potatoes and Hakka noodles. Honey chilli potatoes were yummy. Hakka noodles was a bit dry so felt like it lacked flavour. Could be better
4,This place is for family and if you are a group who are bit noisy then better avoid it. The food here is very good and staff is very co-operative.
3,"First and foremost, this is a vegetarian place serving Vietnamese and Thai delicacies. Thumbs up for those who prefer veg-only restaurants. Nice ambience, simple and well maintained. Courteous staff and the spread/menu is quite well thought-of... They don't offer too much on the menu.The price is slightly higher.We tried the Laksa Soup and Tofu in tomato pepper sauce...both turned out to be very delicious.Pad Thai noodles turned out to be average, would be good to have more vegetables.Vietnamese style sauce over crispy noodles was tasty, but the corn was spoilt/stale.The experience started off being very good and ended on a below average note.The staff were also cooperative to the extent of accommodating Fries for the kids... Thanks for that."
2,"Ordered for a burnt garlic fried rice and vegetables in sZechuan sauce. I had checked with them if they could make my order spicy and when they confirmed, I asked them to make the entire order spicy.The order came in, with some room temperature undone rice with pockets of chilli flakes in the veg gravy. There were no sauces sent with it whatsoever! Why am I giving it a 2? The packing was good :)"
4,"A must visit restaurant for all vegetarian Thai lovers, the food was very tasty and authentic.Must try the Lakas soup and raw papaya salad.However I did not like the Vietnamese paper roll which is their specialty."
5,"Saw this place at 4th block with a cuisine of chinese, thai & veitnamese. Always wanted to try such a combination of cuisines which enriches your soul and mind. Rain , the soothing music , and a good company is always the best scenario at any resto i have been too. Firstly the fruit flavoured mojitos , dumplings , and the first time indulged glass noodles which was an amazing dish. Lastly the dessert which i crave for the pannacotta , choclate flavoured was relishing and deliciously melting. ? A must visit for an amazing lunch date."
2,"Been there for a dinner with friends, veg only Indianised Vietnamese cuisine. Decent ambiance with friendly staff. Service was lil slow.We ordered laksa soup (Thai curry soup) -ok, raw papaya salad - good, Vietnamese rice paper rolls - great, water chestnut stir fry - not good.Main course: glass noodles - good, Thai curry and coconut rice were not good again.F y I - This place charges 10% service charge on top of the bill, which is a rip off.Prices are on expensive side compared to the quality and quantity they serve.You can park on the curb side, no Valet."
3,Authentic asian and thai food cuisine restaurant. We ordered one karfi leaf lime cooler which was too sour. Then we had a raw papaya and tomato salad which was really good and mouth watering. Next we had thai curry and burnt garlic noodles. Noodles were perfectly cooked and the curry was super delicious. They serve pretty large portions. One dish makes your tummy full. But a nice place for trying out authentic food.
4,"If you are looking for a good Asian Restaurant, you are looking at one interesting place in Jayanagar-We tried their Vegetable fritters on sugarcane sticks. It was delicious, I would say and would definitely recommend. The sauce that is given along with it is equally tasty. For the main course we had the stir fried glass noodles where the noodles were made out of Tapioca which was good but could have had more flavor to it.Their ambiance is simple and very elegant. A very nice place to take your family along.Their service is pretty good and they explain their dishes very well. It could be more affordable."
3,"Ambience is simple and yet so elegant. The manager who greets and takes orders is fantastic. I was delighted to see so much variety on an Asian menu for vegetarians. We didnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât want to experiment and went ahead and ordered whatever was suggested by the manager.We had the rice paper rolls and it was okay. Extremely bland but the different textures and colours involved made it interesting. We then got the Vietnamese coconut rice and Vietnamese curry. Sticky fried rice of sorts was quiet good but the flavour of the curry was excellent. Good option for vegetarians craving for some Asian food on the vicinity.The only downfall here is the service charge of 10% they levy and except for the manager, all other service staff are amateur and need a lot of training"
2,"Ambience - 4/5Service - 4/5Food - 1/5We did try a lot of different things.Vietnamese coffee, half moon dumpling , hot pot , rice rolls , Pannacotta, sizzling brownie.None of them tasted goodExtremely disappointed and will never go back to the place."
4,This is quite small and cute place to visit. Always this place will be filled with youngsters. Lassi are great here we do get varieties if lassi and itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs taste good. This will be open till 11pm.
3,"This place is located in the heart of kumarswamy layout and you can find it on the left side while heading towards Kumarswamy layout bus stand. I headed here for break fast and had Idly, Kharabath and Coffee. To keep it simple, the idly was good and is accompanied by Sambar which tasted good too. It wasn't sweet like how we get in other places. Kharabath was good too and I liked it. Chutney was cold and that's something that they will have to work on. Finally had coffee and was given to my liking. No complaints there. The other thing that they will have to work on is the presence of flies. Lot of them. I kind of didn;t like it much. They will have to find out a way to keep it away. No other complaints and it's easy on pocket too.. Good food."
3,"Very good location with extended parking place. My advice is do not even try to visit when the place is crowded. The quality degrades exponentially, even though the price is high"

1,"#Zomoto still failed to keep there standards and delay in live chat, after making online payment immediately order confirmed by restaurant #kantisweets without seeing stocks are available or not. Seriously they fucked me you by responding me after 1.30hr by saying items are not available and cancelled order."
2,"Guys don't ever try their Bombay Halwa. It's highly elastic/ rubbery, they charged me 58 Rs for 2 pcs. It really sucks..I have called up the store and unfortunately, they say it's their speciality."
3,always they replace the items. this time I got same items twice.
1,Mixture quality was very bad. I think it's old stock. It smells bad. I had to throw in dust bin. It's waste of money. If I eat stomach will upset. Be careful these people are selling bad quality if order online. Don't support this kind of business.
3,Whenever we order through online the Snacks it will take the order but after they will confirming no snacks are not available. It's so disappointed
4,"Kanti is my go to sweet shop most of the times. Taste & quality is their trademark. However they sometimes miss to fulfill the deliveries. I wish them not to forget the online customers, if they want to lead in the market."

5,Kaaju katli is just awesome. And the best place to purchase Bengali sweets.. and rasmali sweet available here is amazing... Must try sweets are here
4,Located on a busy four way road of Srinivasanagar..this establishment is a sole provider of good quality sweets. I love the angoori gulab jamoon and angoori petha. Petha is the best one of all sweets.Quality: 4/5Location: 4/5Variety of sweets: 4/5Staff mannerism: 5/5
3.5,Its close by and one of the big names in the sweet mart industry. Smallish outlet. Good for the odd Kachori craving. Sweets are good too Kaju roll and sohan halwa. They make a decent bhel puri too.
4,"Love this place for delicious sweets. I am fond of sweets, a natural feature for a north Indian :)You get some good tasty sweets, but range of items is not so great. I wish they get more items on their shelves."
5,I love Kanti sweets:-) its best is Khaju barfi
5,Amazing handcrafted pizza which is mouth watering. Enjoy the tasty veg pizza and pasta made from really fresh vegetables. You get new yummy unique flavours of pizza.
5,"I have tried pizza many places, but I feel if you are a vegetarian this is the place to go. Pizza will be very yummy. You can feel the cheese ?"
5,"This has been by far the best pizza I have ever had the pizza has the right amount of flavours so it doesnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât overflow and the garlic bread has the right amount of cheese, overall perfect execution, Love the place."
5,"This is by far the best pizza I've ever had. The sauce has a tangy flavour to it and the crust is perfectly baked. Excellent pizza's with fresh toppings. There's a pineapple pizza for which the sauce is exclusively made from pineapple. They have a good variety of pizzas, worth every penny."
5,Vegetalia is the best place selling yummy pizza and garlic bread. The pizza taste is top class and you can actually feel the freshness in each and every bite. I have not been able to like pizza from any other chain after tasting Vegetalia pizza. From kids to elders everyone in our family just love it!!
3,Pizza not worth for money. Taste should be improved.pizza base is very hard. Should provide more options to choose from the menu for the price
5,An exquisite place for pizza lovers out there!!!!Quality and taste are up to the mark??Go and check-out for some amazingly good food!!!???
5,"Vegetalia has a pizza for everyone. My kids loved the pineapple pizza and we loved the spicy and yummy Spicy-6. We have tried all pizzas here and can say that these are the best vegetarian pizzas. Being a vegetarian, ordering pizzas from other shops was always a concern after a bad experience with another shop. Here we can order vegetarian pizzas with peace of mind, since Vegetalia only serves vegetarian pizzas. Vegetalia is the only pizza shop we go to now. Tip: If you are spice lover, do not miss out on Spicy-6 and Hot N Spicy."
5,"Vegetalia brings us such yumm, delicious and rich pizzas that we now have forgotten other famous brands. This has done what LayÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs did for chips! Yes, no one can eat just one :)The flavours, variety and the amount of veggies/sauce make them irresistible!Recently tried their pasta (cream & pink) and they were just top class!Thank you Vegetalia and best wishes :)"
5,"The pizza here is simply out of the world! The fact that everything from the base to the veggies to the cheese is fresh just adds to the flavours. When you take a bite, you can taste it all...the crispiness of the bread, the stringiness of the cheese, the bite of the sauce and the freshness of veggies!!! All in all amazing pizzas that fill you tummy and your heart all the while being completely light on the pocket!!! Awesome job Vegetalia!!!"
5,"This is one stop spot for Pizza. Be it with base bread, cheese, vegetables used, everything is fresh, taste amazing and are of the best quality. Preparation of is done is a very clean place. As got the information from founder himself, he has grows some of the herbs and veggies by himself. We had ordered pizza for a Birthday Party for a group of 25 people (6 to 65 years age group) irrespective of the age group, everyone enjoyed those lovely pizza to heart content.Gralic Bread...once you have it, you cannot undo the memory of that taste. It is Gralicious.Special Note: Owner has a special pineapple based sauce, which he uses for Pineapple Pizzas, Please DO ASK for it and taste it, It is just out of the world. At the time of we ordering, he was making it as a limited edition product with pre-orders."
5,This is by far the best pizzeria ever. The pizzas here are so good!! I do not order from any other pizzeria other than Vegetalia now. This has been a benchmark for me. I donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât see any other pizzeria matching the standards and taste as that of Vegetalia.A big thumbs up for Quality of pizzas.The taste is just out of this world!!I Highly recommend everybody to try Vegetalia pizzas!Thank You Vegetalia!Cheers!
5,I have been taking delivery from this restaurant I can tell you the quality of pizza is better than that of the Pizza Hut or any other international brands. They serve only vegetarian pizzas. Perfect for vegetarians
1,Chicken kabab is not good and the quantity is very less for 110rs. Very disappointed with the delivery. Should increase the quantity or should decrease the price
1,Worst kabab and briyani I ever ate.Very bad quality food simply wastage of money same price we can get better food in other hotel through zomato
1,The given kebab is not even worth for 20rs. Worst experience for first time. Need to improve. Otherwise may lose the customers. I'll not order anything again here.
1,"I did not like the chicken guntoor fry asinstead of dry it was full of gravy and floating oil. I ordered for dry item and I got a curry item. Not trust worthy. In addition, the packing was without Zomato label."
1,Worst food I received from this restaurant. I order Kabab in zomato but I got 3 pieces of bad quality kabab. Very bad experience. Banashankari branch very worst.
1,"our ratings never make a difference, horrible food Zomato"
4,very spicy
3,less quantity
1,"These guys are cunning! Be careful! The quantity are not same, when they run offer. I got very very less quantity. DonÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât trust their offers. Zomato have to act on this to keep their customers"
1,Chicken fry is not at all good..i could see only oil..no gravy and just 3 pieces..did i ordered oil box or chicken fry??Not happy and donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât look this hotel again
4,good test
5,"tasty food, lollipop was little spicy make it little low because children can eat it"
1,ordered for 2nd time Biryani rice was not good and pepper chicken was very spicy full of bones and chicken pieces not cooked properly
5,I ordered chicken biryani and chicken lollipop the taste was awesome & the price is reasonable place was clean. And I like to visit with my family one's.
5,"Probably the best donne biryani at an affordable price! The chilly chicken is a spice lovers delight! It's a must have!.Do not go there for the ambience, its a place that serves amazing food at economical pricing."
3,"Taste - 3.5/5Great place for quick bites. And trust me, they're filling as well as tasty.The rolls are really good and so are the parathas. For the quantity and taste, the price is fair and towards the lower end, which is great."
2,A tiny outlet present right behind the BMS college. They serve North Indian food. Parathas are must try. Actually a saviour when you are broke.
5,"Very good place and varieties flavor of ice cream ,cake , pastry n sweets.Love this place.Good place for ice cream n cake lovers in Bangalore ."
4,"Been to this place with two of my Foodie friends.This is situated opposite to Lalbagh West gate.

They have introduced a new drink by name "" GOLD FOGG"" similar to red bull.1) Mojito : The simple lime juice mojito with monin syrup.2) Cheesy peri peri fries : These were so good chess on top and peri peri.3) loaded nacho's : Nachos loaded with cheese and tomatoes.

4,"""Energy Adda"" a cafe located on 3rd floor near lalbagh Metro Station and it's very easy to spot it. The place has a average ambience and good area of seating.Dropped down here with a bunch of friends and tried some of there items.In drinks we ordered Oreo Fantasy Shake and Ferraro Rocher Shake. Both the shakes were made to perfection. The taste and presentation was really very good.In starters we tried Loaded Nachos and Peri Peri Fries. Nachos was very amazing with the cheese topped on it, giving it a perfect flavor. The quantity for the fries was very good as per the pricing.They have a large varieties of pizza and we ordered Tandoori Panner Veg Pizza. It was very unique and delicious. Panner pieces were topped on the crunchy base of pizza and served to our table. The taste was really amazing.I highly recommend this place to try out if you are searching some good veg cafe to dine in. Energy adda will not disappoint you :)ujjwallok.wordpress.com"

5,"Energy adda is definitely one of the best cafes to hangout with friends around basavagudi.I personally love the shakes and pizzas here.Must try: peri peri fries, dryfruit shake#rajeshwrites"
4,"Visited this place with a few of my friends and I was impressed with the range of offering they had from helath food to the tasty food, ideal for health conscious and foodies. Even though I was delighted by they healthy choices I was more tempted with pastas and pizzas not to forget this desserts.This place definitely will appeal to the youngsters also for the Hookha on the terrace.Lastly a special mention to the staff who was extremely friendly, after all it's them you make us feel comfortable and add the extra bit the experience.My next visit I am definitely trying more of the pizza and a few salads too ?"
4,"A cafe with two floors located at the main signal of lal baghSimple decent ambiencePrices are reasonableThey have healthy menu which includes healthy raw juices mocktails shakes and fruit saladsDesserts , pizzas, sandwiches, pastas, burgers and salads to go withI had Oreo and kitkat shakes loaded with chocolates and cream yummy it wasThen a fruit salad fresh and topped with vanilla scoopsRed velvet pastry and dbc and brownie were fresh and niceGreen garden and paneer tikka pizza were delicious loaded with cheese and veggiesPesto pasta and spaghetti with triple sauce were creamyOverall had a good experience good place to chill"
3,"Wanted a change so was looking for a new place I read good reviews on Zomato so Monday we visited this place. Place was empty it was just us. It's a small nice place, view from the place is awesome. Staff was friendly.We orderedPeri Peri Fries - crispy and tastyAmerican Green Special pizza - could have added more vegetablesGrill paneer with lettuce sandwich- was very tastyApple, beetroot, carrot juice - very healthy drinkMint watermelon- equally goodTheir healthy drinks are the best else it's like any other place. I feel it's slightly on higher side. 900rs for 2 ppl is expensive"
1,"I packed a full meal and in the meal we received, the rice and sambar was good, the tambuli was not good. It tasted like vomit. The beans palya was spoilt. I called the restaurant and told them the problem. They said that they did quality check before I ordered. That time everything was good. So in just five minutes of time that I ordered and took it home, it spoiled? I will never order from that place again."
3,It's a small place.. better to take parcel as the place seems unhygienic and is pretty cramped up.. food is quite ok and filling and cheap too
2,"Well nothing special to say about this place. Pretty cramped up for space, not so appealing. Just okay okay for a quick bite. Had the chicken Biriyani, grilled chicken combo, roti and egg burji and a half grill chicken. Have to say that the grilled chicken was the only thing that seemed a bit good for me. Was disappointed. The other turn off is that smoke keeps filling up due to the tandoor and constant grilling."
3,"I ordered quarter of each, tandoori, grill and tandoori - grilled( never tried so wanted to try it).Delivery took nearly one and half hour. Then there was only one kind of chicken which was looking like tandoori and grill both. It had red color of tandoori and retained skin of the chicken as we usually see in grill. Taste was not great. Was not bad either. never got to try their tandoori and grill as of individually. Instead got their fusion of both.I will never order from there again till i have any other option. They cant get the orders straight."
2,"Have been here twice .The first time I went,pav bhaji was too good . Where as the 2nd time,it was horrible .Love their dahi puri n sweets."
5,Best chaats and street food!Pani puri and Sev puri are so good and flavourful!The vada Pav is very nice.Tawa pulao here isnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât that good here.But overall a good experience.
5,We had jilebi rabadi and rasamilai and no words literally. It was that awesome. Thank for that shop in bangalore. The perfect chaat corner. Looking for more eating experiences.
4,"If you are a Bangalorean and a foodie, your favorite place is definitely the food street and the range of options that are available, so here is one good place on food street:They have an amazing Tawa Pulao and Pav Bhaji. The dry snacks are very average. But it is amazing to feast on their Pav Bhaji's and Tawa Pulao.Their rabdi on the sweets are delicious and mouth-watering which makes you feel it was worth the stop.As the street name goes, it is food street and you have to stand out hold your plates and feast on. There is no luxury of seats and seating on food street. They have a good hygiene levels inside when you give a peek in."
4,PERFECT FOR NORTH INDIAN CHAT LOVERS!!WHAT is BEST here:THE DESERT!! Malpua..GULAB JAMUN.. RABDI!! is jss muuaaaahhhhhh !!Raj Kachori. Dahi poori are awesome too..

4,"Had a pizza here, absolutely awesome experience and accommodating on the requests also. Nice ambience and asks us to write feedback on the painted wall any where in the outlet"
3,"VFM 3/5Taste 3.5/5Ordered from this place, chicken biryani was average, it was little tangy and no where close to the authentic hyderabadi biryaniGuntur chicken was average, garlic chicken was amazing though!"
3,"Had been to this place with family. Its very to locate this place. The food is average. One major drawback which i noticed is that in the first floor the windows are open and not covered with any mesh, if there is no wind then mosquito bite is guranteed. I request the management to cover it with mesh if possible."
5,Haven't visited this place but ordered breakfast couple of times. The breakfast was soo yummy. The pancake was perfect in size and taste. I would definitely suggest their omlete which really tasted good.Definitely will order from this place.
4,"I havenÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât had the opportunity to visit this place but I have ordered in quite a few times. What I like about Grazers is that the food is good and has its own individuality.The portions are good and taste yummy. I recently tried the crispy joes, both egg and chicken ones and loved them. The outside is just right and the filling fresh and delicious. The burgers are also a mouthful, served with sauce and fries. I had the basil and chicken burger and the crispy chicken burger.Definitely a great place to eat at!"
3,"Located in Jayanagar 3rd block this place is right at the junction and tough to miss.Known for its breakfast and Italian food, I thought of giving this place a shot.I have previously ordered multiple breakfast item via other services and they haven't disappointed.However, today was a bit different.We ordered fish fingers which in my opinion was bland. It was just crispy on the out and soft but tasteless inside.Their chicken sausage was decent, no wow factor.Ordered a single drink apple crancider which was a combination of cranberry and apple cider vinegar, this was decent as well but had a slight harsh sensation in the throat due to the apple cider vinegar.So overall not a great experience but would like to try it out again to see how their pastas and pizza taste."
4,We ordered for I got cheesed pizza and double veg burger... aww was so cheesesy and yummy burger..loved the hot and sweet flavor and the crispy crunch... must try for a cheese lover... ohh just ate it quick dint take the pic.. ?
5,Amazing burgers and fries.. Do make sure to try their steak burger it is really yum and pocket friendly.. The fries are perfectly crisp to that crunch factor in your mouth..
4,"Just came to this cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå© to enjoy good American Hotdog, Piri-Piri French fries, Watermelon and Muskmelon Smoothies, Potato Wedges. It was amazing I must say! Kudos"
4,I absolutely loved Crispy JoeÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs here and would recommend everyone to try it out . The ambience is pretty decent to hang out with couple of your friends and pretty economical too!
4,We wanted to check this place as we would pass this place daily. It was fairly empty even though it was a Friday evening. These guys need to publicize the place.The ambiance was chilled out and neatly decorated. We ordered a BBQ Cottage Cheese Hot Dog and I got cheezed Pizza.The Hot Dog had big chunks of Cottage Cheese tossed with barbeque sauce and fried onions. It was served with hot crisp french fries and a unique delicious chutney - Coriander flavored Mayonnaise. We wanted to try a cheesy pizza and ordered the famous Margarita. Cheesy delicious topping on a thin crust pizza base made it all worthwhile. There was a slight hint of spiciness in the cheese topping and we loved it. Grazers should publicize the place. They have unique dishes and served hot to patrons. Visit this place and i am sure you wont be disappointed.pikle.in
3,"The amazing exterior pulls you in but the food doesn't do justice to it at all.Ordered the Thai Curry and a Burger. Both the dishes were lacking in flavor and taste. The food is not pocket friendly nor mouth watering. Staff is polite but nothing can beat good taste, so I wish they serve food cooked with passion."
4,I loved the way they had send the food and the bread and omlet was just as a i wanted. Food was fresh and warm. Had a good breakfast today. Please if u need a wholesome breakfast order or visit this place
5,"One of the best places of milk shake, classes milkshake and fusion milkshake are available. I tried Oreo and choco brownie milkshakes and all milkshake are very thick."
5,"It's a small cute place but the people running the place have big hearts. Really lovely people. More than the food you really need to experience their friendliness and immense generosity. Don't get me wrong though, the food's great too! We ordered the peri peri sandwich and spinach corn sandwich and really liked the taste. Also, do order their litchi milkshake."
5,"This is one small cute outlet in Jayanagar,They serve sandwiches and shakes.. Had been there for work bt being a sandwich lover couldn't resist myself from ordering sandwich..

One quaint little cafe tucked in a corner yet very much visible from the main road. My quest for good shakes was on, and here I was!. Since the last few days, I have been ordering shakes at midnight while binge watching Netflix and I have tried a lot of outlets for the same. Hands down, this has been the best till date. When I checked out the menu, the first thing that caught my eye was the Red Velvet Cheese cake shake, and when I got to know that the cake is prepared in-house, I had to try this one out.

2,"This was Zomato Delivery order.Usually we try new restaurant every time we order from Zomato, this time it was Chilli Flakes.We ordered Corn Spenich & cheese sandwich, Smoked Burger & Momos.Momos were 10 pcs, packaging was ok. Sauce was different then what we usually get at other outlet but it was ok. Momos were also nice.Sandwich was not good as it was grilled in oil or the stuffing was made in it and we feel it's a cheap oil as we don't get such flavour and smell in any other sandwich we had till date. Due to this it didn't taste good. Filling was kind of ok, there was no filling on the edges. Packing was nice it was wraped in wraping paper inside a big box.Smoked burger was also ok, there was negligent vegetables present. Only 1 pc of cucumber, there was no tomato or lettuce. Also I mentioned no onions in special instructions but still there was onion.There was smell in burger as well. Patty was fried in same oil.Overall it was not a good experience."
1,They r pakka loffers they r always cheating don't choose this restaurant lots of gud restaurant are there don't waste ur money here taste is very bad and quality worst we r planning to complaints to food inspector
1,poor quality food received will not order again
1,"No taste for curries and got less than the number of quantity ordered. Least expected as your order got delivered, and you find that there was less number of rotis than u ordered( for which i have paid). Menu looks good but food taste is not satisfying. No more CALCUTTA CAFE for me, not again."
3,less quantity... good taste
1,They don't know how to cook anything.. All rubbish item.. Just naming Calcutta will not dooo... I have order 2 egg roll priceing 60 each was made on wheat roti without salad sauce just horrible then 1 veg cutlet pricing 50 was horrible like anything you can get better than this in footpath.. Egg cutlet please don't ask... It was all horrible... I ate since I spend money and now feeling like vomiting... Please don't order anything until u visit there personally
3,The chicken curry was very good but according to the price 2 piece of chicken for rs.80 was not worthy....the chicken curry was very tasty and delicious
2,missing food item
4,"They prepare an amazing tea. My every weekend place for tea along with my friends.The fried maggi, CC special maggi, the egg dragon are my favorites on the menu.Please do try the Biryani.Prices are really reasonable, mind that.And they are specialized in bengali dishes, so all the bengali people in the house, please do try that place. ?"
5,I had ordered aloo Posto and it was too good price wise also great loved it and wish to order again not too oily pieces were good and had sumptuous taste
5,"Good quality food but quantity is not adequate in accordance with price charged. Need more improvement in cooking. Overall out of 5, I will rate it 3.8"
1,"The place offers authentic Bengali food. I ordered mutton biryani from this outlet. The quantity was not adequate and even though they charged 300rs for a single biryani, it had only two very small pieces of mutton. Not at all worth the money thats paid for it. Very disappointing. Certainly will not order from here."
4,i think they charging high for fish fry!
1,"I don't know what went wrong but the veg meal I ordered had dal which had turned sour and the chhole sabji had gone bad too. The rice, papad and aloo bhaja were fine."
5,very very delicious food
5,The best food i ever had.. basically m from Mumbai but now after having the cuisine in calcutta cafe i m in love with bengali foods..an awesome delicious cuisine
5,"A perfect bong touch in each and every cuisine that I order and the food is really delicious, appetizing and luscious. The evry time I order for I get an upmost satisfaction"
5,"Ordered Chicken Biriyani, and the taste was just wow....!! Authenticated Bengali dishes you will get in this place-Great taste and food with Quality."
5,Had ordered food twice and had also visited the place with my bf and friends. Great food! The Indian and Bengali menu is a must!! Oh yes the aloo posto and mutton with rice and dal is awesome.The dal is just like how my mom cooks at home. Thank you Calcutta cafe.
5,Yummy Bengali food is what you get here.Specially the sorse Ilish and mutton. I am planning to take my parents there once they r in the town.Yummy.
1,Is this mutton kosha worth of 195??? Really disappointing. As per the menu 3pieces for 195.here am getting two small pieces that too one of them is bone.. They're jus cheating the customer
5,Once my order was spoilled by the delivery person Calcutta Cafe had reprocessed the order and gave my order again..thanks guys..and loved the taste of your food also..??
5,The perfect place to chill with chai and sutta in the evening with your friends in Kumaraswamy Layout followed by their variety of meal platters. The ambience is amazing.
3,"My love for ice creams never ends.This place was in my wish list from long time and visited today.This place is located in the busy area near Banashankari and is identifiable easily.Coming to the ambience, the place is very quiet and cosy with good fancy seatings and lightings.Food:1)Mud-pie mojo: it majorly had coffee and chocolaty taste and wasn't that great :(2) paan masala: it is the special ice cream in this place and was the best! It had the actual flavour of paan?.Service was quick :)"
4,"Mumbai's popular Ice cream chain, Old Mumbai Ice Cream is now in Bangalore. The newest addition to Banashankari's list of ice cream parlors is located right next to Stoned Monkey ice cream bar. Talk about taking competition head on!They serve a variety of ice cream flavors - Roasted Almond, Gajar ka Halwa, Coffee Almond, Kaju Kishmish, Kesar Pista, Coconut Malai, Black Forest, Anjeer Honey, Peru(Guava) with chilli powder, Sitaphal, Mango, Paan.You can buy the ice cream by the scoop, or try their different stoned sundaes. I tried the Coffee Almond, & Coconut Malai - loved them both.With their pleasant ambience and affordable prices, this is a place worth visiting!"
4,"Brightly lit icecream shop that's open until 1AM! Perfect for a large night craving.Tried the nutella brownie and red velvet sundaes. In both, ingredient components were put together via the popular stone and metal scraper. Loved the nutella sundae as the taste was fantastic.Also sampled the dutch truffle milkshake. It's a cake shake, which means they incorporate a cake into their shake giving it an essentially cakey thick consistency. Great for chocolate lovers, it's flavour is intensely chocolate and not overpowered by sweetness.In all, good dessert spot. Loved that the shakes came in glass bottles. Hopefully they can reduce their plastic footprint by replacing their plastic straws with a more environmentally friendly substitute."
1,"Had been here to taste Asli wala Mumbai Icecream, but we were fully disappointed ? with the taste and presentation. Not worth it to pay so much for the Icecream. Nothing special was there. The taste was not so good. We did not feel the taste of Icecream. Even the presentation was not up to the mark. It made us to feel like do not eat. I request the team to improve their taste and presentation of the product. No essence of Mumbai is seen anywhere in the outlet/Icecream?Price: 2/5Taste:1/5Quantity:3/5 quantity was good but no use if taste is not up to the markPresentation:1/5Ambiance:3/5"
5,"Another stone icecream addition to Banashankari. Right next to infamous stoned monkey, they have accepted the challenge to give them a tough competition. Good variery of ice creams. Nice ambience. Friendly staff. VFM 5 on 5, taste 4 on 5, staff behaviour 5 on 5. They are open till 1am. Yay!Advice to management: play some soft music may be."
5,Biriyani is yummm here !! Just a kushka and kabab would satisfy a hungry tummy... and it's completely reasonable and worth it.. chilly chicken is also tasty and very spicy here
3,Decently priced and worth a money.Pepper chicken was well made along with the perfect fry. As it was home delivery they took some time but food served for good.
5,RATED Good guy
4.5,"One of the best coffee in town and one of the most fluffiest idlys you can every eat in Bangalore !! Reminds you of home food this joint offers a walk down the memory lane when you try their chutney! They open only in the evenings in this location. It's right next to the Bull Temple park where tons of people folk around for an evening snack. So if you're health conscious and don't want to have any junk food after you have just burned down your calories taking that evening walk, stop by here to get a whiff of the yummy coffee and something for your craving tummy."
5,"Very homely south Indian food... amazing breakfast on an affordable price... food quality is amazing... fast service.. delicious coffee..! Tasty Idli, vada.. extraordinary chutney..."
3.5,"This place is not meant to be here because we get to taste the similar dishes in the entire street. Hope they try out something different like Hollige, akki roti, and many more authentic dishes"
4.5,Pocket friendly idlis and vadas. They also sell yummy crisps dosas and a large variety of yummy holiges. Coffee is great and the jamuns are yumm.
4.5,"Super soft idlis, dipped in tasty Chatni ?..Clean and hygiene. Must visit in 'Tindi beedi'. Don't forget to have Coffee/tea. Worth the struggle of finding a parking place and pocket friendly."
4,"No need to introduce By2coffee, the all famous darshini is now open in the famous VV PURAM St. Their menu is the same as the other places very simple and very tasty , good to see these guys opening branches in diff places , hope they open one in Koramangala also?. Taste wise I don't have to comment bcoz they have set their standards and it's very good in all the branches and special mention of the coffee ??? it's soooo soooo gud."
4,"By 2 CoffeeBst Authenic South Indian fast food I can sujjest in the locality. They make excellent Idly and Vada.They have a simple menu like Idly, Vada, Chow Chow Bath and Hot Beverages.Hence it is located in the Food Street at V.V Puram, located next to Rajasthani Paratha Point. Opp to Venkateshwara swami temple.Headed around 10 in the night and the crowd was the same in the outlet.Ordered Idly Vada and was served with in no time.Idly was hot and fresh. Vada was big enough for the price and crispy.Chutney was fresh and good in taste. It was great combination for Idly and Vada.Food - 4/5Service - 4/5Cleanliness - 4/5Hospitality - 4/5Must Try - Idly Vada"
4,"Kedias Fun Food - located near Maiyas in Jayanagar 4th block is a tasty paradise for a foodie ! ?You will love the taste of the food served here!, there is no seating offered, you need to stand and eat. They do have home delivery through multiple delivery partners. We visit here very often!my favourite on the menu is channa bhatura, I love the taste here!there are chats you can choose for, Also liked the tasre if raj kachori. Pav bhaji is very good! and Veg cutlet is not bad.You can also try parathas here.And don't forget to have rasgulla ! it's damn good.? One of the best in the locality!? Love the taste!"
5,"First visit here just made my day ??...I tried pav bhaji, aloo sabji Puri, paneer paratha and vada pav and everything was best in their own flavours n the pav bhaji was fabbbbbbb??.... Although it's the very small shop but the flavours in their dishes will make you come here again and again just loved the taste of bhaji still the flavours are in my taste buds would love to come here again to try their Chaat varieties."
5,"I absolutely love the food at Kedias. Its authentic, made with love and lip-smackingly delish.The paranthas are a must try. We couldn't keep our hands off the dahi papdi Chaat.Going back for more"
3,"Had ordered pav bhaji,vada pao and masala soda.the price is pretty much good.the taste was also good.the order took much time for delivery though.except that the experience was good.the chaats are also good."
2,This place is not at all good for delivery. My order was late by 1 hour. Food was cold. Its better to go there and eat. The aloo cheese parantha had no cheese. The cheese fondue was soggy
4,"This is the place to go if you are craving good, authentic chaats. It has been my haunt for 5 years now. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a small outlet that offers chaats and juices. They are reasonably priced and delectable as well.I have tried the pain puri, bhel puri, vada Pav, paratha, tiki chaat, samosa, Pav bhaji, kachori, Rasgulla chaat and they are all yummy.The juices are good too. They serve spicy fried salted chillies, green chutney and imli chutney as assortments.There is no place to sit and eat, you just pick your order and eat standing. But the food is worth it.The place in Jayanagar for some good chaat with the North Indian feel!"
4,"Recommended - Kachori (plain)Pav BhajiRasgullaLet down - Pani Puri and Channa Masala.Pav Bhaji was amazing!! So was kachori super crispy and fresh.I had high hopes on channa batura, batura was really soft and crispy but the channa masala was not good taste wise (however the channa was cooked to perfection).Taste 4/5Hygiene 3/5Price 5/5Serving size 3.5/5 (they serve very less channa for 2 huge baturas)"
4,"Ordered Khaman Dhokla, Aloo Vada Pav, Aloo Paratha and Jhal Muri.Packing was fine, all the orders were hot, now coming to the taste.Dhokla was fine, Vada Pav was superb one of the best I had in recent time, Aloo Paratha was good with nice filling, Jhal Muri was bit fine."
3,"Went here for Sunday morning breakfast. It's a damn small outlet famous for its north Indian snacks(chats, kachori etc) and parathas.There is no seating or any dedicated area for even standing. You literally have to eat on road.( Only negative point)The food is just amazing and place is bang for the buck.I tried kachori chaat ( it was very good )Poha- okayish.Chole bhature- it was also good.Do give it a try if you are around.Peace??"
4,We had ordered home food from here. Masala puri was yum. Samosa was average. Dhokla was too good. Dahi Aloo tikki chaat was very very bland. Best part was their chutneys. It was very very nice.
3,"The food here is really good but the ambience and service disappointed me. It's a very tiny shop which is crowded and does not have proper seating. They have a lot of options on parathas, chats, sodas and much more. The items are moderately priced but the quantity is a little less. I triedÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ Dhokla - Very good. Served with green chutney as well as sweet chutney.ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ Pav bhaji - Good but the taste of bhaji wasn't exceptional.ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ Masala puri - Good.ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ Dahi puri - Excellent. This item is a must try here."
4,"Well you get almost everything here. Pav bhaji is too good. Vada paav is nice. Pav bhaji had good flavours, paav was loaded with butter. Chaat items are also good."
4,"This is the best joint in jaynagar area to fill your desire for North Indian cuisines and fast food. Paranthas, vada pav, chole bhathure, etc are just a few of the lip smacking items served here. There's no place to sit but the food is served almost immediately and is hygienic and pocket friendly in nature . You cannot get enough of this place."
3,This place is situated at near Jayanagar police station. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a place for good chats and parathas. Had ordered vegetable cutlets but received the cutlets in a very bad state. The chats here are good. This place is a self service restaurant. You will have to be ready to stand on the streets and eat.Staff - 2/5Food- 3/5Ambience-0/5
4,"I love going to Jayanagar and needed only an excuse. Kedia's fun food gave me one.As the name suggests, the food is north Indian in nature and is 'fun' as they serve your fast foods such as chats, paranthas, vada pavs and so on.I had the Vada pav (awesome), Raj Kachori (not bad at all) and Aloo Tikki (definitely worth it).The place is a tad bit crowded (naturally) and has plenty of other joints nearby for other foods or drinks. The service time and value for money is good."
4,"I was never aware of this place unless some of my close friends who stay in Jayanagar suggested this.This is a small shop which is crowded very much in the evening because of the tasty food they serve??I tried their dahi puri, which was decent??Their aloo Tikki chat was tasty??Their Vada pav is something I would die for on a rainy day.Its tooo tasty.?? Heard that their Rasgulla chat is also good.will definitely try it the next time soon"
4,I have been visiting this place for 1 year and it has been a good experience every time you can get chats and many North Indian foods at cheap rate with good quality and ambience
5,I will keep this short..Kedias is essentially your childhood on a plate. The Bangalore version of chats is curd and carrots on everything. The chats here will make every North Indian proud. Recommended wholeheartedly
5,"Had been here yesterday to add some Spicy Flavour to my Sweet Life??..""KEDIAS"" at JAYANAGAR--- A perfect place for chats ...so many varities of chats .....varities of parotas....Dhabeli is one of my favourite chat in Kedias..... I personally liked Kedias and i will prefer all chat lovers to have all the variety of chats here in Kedias.... Surely u will love it like a hell....... Vada pawas are so tastely ..... Chilli (Fried Chilli's) with all chats will make ur chats more spicy ??... Its mouth wasting??...!!!They even have variety of Lassies..milk shakes...sodas...fresh juices ...golas and chapaties....Sev puri was soooo good i loved it ....it was sweet and spicy.....vada pav was also sooo tasty and it was full of spice with a chilliii......yummyyy....All these made my evening soo spicy and chillyy.....#chats lovers#foodies#bangalore diaries##"
4,"Located in jayangar ....very much in the main circle area.Its a little shop where you are expected to stand and help yourself with the delicacies of North India.They have varieties of parathas and chaats with other desserts and beverages like lassi,butter milk etc.Though the quantity is little less but the taste of their chaats and chole bhature and kulche is definitely going to make you forget about other inconveniences.In Bangalore if you really want to have the real spicy sour taste of North Indian street food,,one must be going here.Its quite affordable and looks hygienic too though accommodated in a small space."
5,"What a discovery.. being a bangalorean I discovered this place after 15 years. This place is opposite to maiyas in jayangar behind or besides holige place.What options! Anything and everything you would crave for..Must try: bread pakoda, sabudana vada, chole bature, samosa/kachori/aloo tikki chats..If you visit on a weekend then get ready for a min 15 to 20 min waiting time because online orders are so many 80% of the place will be occupied by swiggy delivery boys.I was into food so much I did not even took some snaps there.."
4,"Went here this evening to have Dosa.. It's welcoming and the place is neatly arranged. It's a simple set up and is spacious. I had Kharabath and Butter Masala Dosa. I had requested him to use less butter and roast the dosa. Kharabath was not out of the world or something, but it was good. Since Chutney was not ready yet, I had it without the chutney. I got my Dosa to my liking and it was very good. Loved the dosa and it was made just like how I wanted. Kudos to the guy who prepared it. The bill was 70/- and it was totally worth it. Will surely visit again. The only downside to this place is that the handwash is kept outside and sometimes one will have to stand in line to wash hands ,especially on weekends. They have Phone pay, Magic pin, PayTM as mode of payments other than cash.. Very nice!!"
4,"Small place with only Sharma, delicious and tasty. No place to eat though. Garb n go policy at large. At a very good venue. Good for a quick grab of snacks"

Finally me n my fren visited this place on one evening n just loved it... N many who visited d place were surprised to see the new renovated one which was opened just the day before we visited... Food is very homely n tasty... Will definitely visit again"
3,Visited this place for dinner ambience is ok but small place if ur luking rich creamy kaju gravy with creamy texture n taste pls avoid this place typical dhaba style n taste tried veg kadai panner butter masala n butter roti they were not upto mark for our taste so definitely wil not find those restaurant like taste.
4,This place is my all time favorite to enjoy some authentic Punjabi food and their paneer keema along with tandoori roti is a must try and the chutney they serve along with onions is just awesome ...I just love it?? good service
4,"Tiny little restaurant with great food. You might not find the place appealing with looks but the food is too good. Typical home made Punjabi food. I find the food a little spicy for my pallet but taste wise awesome. I love their phulkas, jeera rice and dal."
4,This is quiet a good place for paratha lovers !! U get all these tasty paratha here... it's pocket friendly and huge bunch of of us usually go to this place..
4,"Small outlet in Banshankari. This place serves authentic Punjabi food. Ambience is not good. Kinda local hotel. It will be very crowded all the time.But food is delicious. Anything you order you won't be disappointed. Tried pulka, paneer do pyaza, butter roti, bhindi fry, aloo gobi, masala papad and lassi. Everything was tasty. Worth having.Price is also reasonable. Must visit place!"
3,Food - 7/10Service - 7/10Ambience - 6/10Cost - 7/10It's a small restaurant with all varieties of north Indian food. The food tastes fine. Staff is a bit slow in service but they do listen to their customers and try to improve it always. It can be a one time visit restaurant for many but u must try it.
4,"Mulubagilu Dose .... Crispy, hot, masala dosa.. The famous Mulubagilu dosa in namma bengaluru....... A must try !! I tried in Mulbagilu during my visit... actually i was searching for this kind of Dosas in Namma Bengaluru .. finally my tummy is Happie."
4,"One of Bangalores oldest restaurants!Ambience hasnt changed since years.Love the masala papad , the mushroom  65 and babycorn chilli in starters!For main course the paneer butter masala and naans are good!A perfect way to end it is with some curd rice :)"
1,Worst option to order food. I ordered veg fried rice from my friend's account. Veg fried rice was extremely oiled the movement we put the rice in plate every where is oil and found some small stone in the rice. I don't know how they are taking care of there customer but the food quality and cooking is more than worst.
5,super taste and quantity
5,Oossmm. Only Legend's knows about this hotel.Nice hospitality situated in main commercial area with antique military style average space with no special interiors. This place is not for family. All starters is mouth watering.
5,"Exelent, always legend ."
1,food no taste
4,"Sunday Noon and my friend and I were damn hungry and we had spoken earlier we wanted to go here.First impressionsItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs next to a Dominos outlet, and there were very few people but there were many people working in the kitchen but the ambience was quite peaceful.ServiceIt is a self serviced outlet and the staff were busy for most of the time we were there. So was the manager/owner who was there next to the staff, doing what the staff did too.FoodWe ordered Mandakki Oggarne, Paddu, Talipattu and Mirchi Bajji. Apart from the Mandakki, all the other items were amazing and ofcourse its not a fast food joint, so they took their time to make it in the best way they could.PS - Talipattu is a must tryOver all IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâd say its a 4/5 only for their sheer lack of understanding of customer service. Hope they are most receptive to the walk-in customers."
4,"Nice place near to kamakya theatre, decent food , girmit was good and worth trying , sabudana vada is nice with less oil ,Ambience:3/5Food:3.5/5"
3,"Ambiance - I really like the rock solid wood furniture used to do up this place and the open kitchen where you can literally see the ladies cooking multiple orders simultaneously.Service - Some dishes are pre-prepared and they take their own sweet time to prepare the other dishes.Price - The prices are on the higher side when compared to the quantity, taste and prices of the other restaurants offering North Karnataka cuisine.Taste - We tried the following items.Mandaakki oggarane - Was bland. Didn't like it.Mirchi bajji - Was served hot yet wasn't great.Millet taalipattu - Best among the dishes tried here. Really healthy and has a unique taste that I haven't got to taste elsewhere.Girmit - Was too spicy to finish.Shenga holige - GoodJowar roti with curry - Tasty but isn't worth the price.* If at all I revisit this place, I would like to try millet bisibelebath."
2,"Unfortunately, this hotel wont survive long.1. Self Service and highly priced2. Absolute mess in the weekend3. Mismanagement of orders4. There is no token system5. Lastly, taste is not worth the price.6. 170 rupees charged for limited 2 rottis.7. There is no follow up service for people who need dishes and sambhars during the dinner/lunchI would not recommend this restuarant for a peaceful meal"
4,"One of the best North karnataka restaurant in the area. Bit pricy compared to other north karnataka eateries, but better option compared to other eateries in and around kamakya. Crowded on weekends and I happen to visit on a Saturday.I happen to try the below things:1. Jolad Rotti(Jawar rotti): basic nothing special with it. Brinjal Palya was tasty. 3.5/52. Holige: we tried their Shenga holige which was average, I like the fact that it was fresh and tasty.Bele holige was prepared fresh it was good too. 4/53.mirchi bajji: good. They use fresh oil. 3.5/5My Ratings: overall 3.5/5Food: good: 3.5/5Ambience: cleaner than any other north karnataka eatery: 4/5Service: Slow. But you get the fresh food. 3/5With LoveThejaswini Mv"
4,"A simple clean and hygienic self service restaurant serving North Karnataka dishes. There are only about 8 to 10 tables and thus be prepared to wait during peak hours. Enjoyed Girmit, Holige, Sabudhana Vada among other dishes."
5,"Great delivery, amazing pizzas. Italiano was really good and so was exotica. Everything seemed fresh and adequate cheese. Also, the volcano cakes were yummy as well! Crust was thick and soft. Will order again soon!"
5,"Okay to be clear I am not a big fan of pizza hut and some branches like Jayanagar are probably the worst I have been to, but the Banashankari branch has some lip smacking offerings coupled with great service whenever I have been there.The pizzas are fresh, straight out of the oven and taste perfect. The only think pizza hut can't recreate is the cheese burst pizza of dominos. Any version of their cheese pizza doesn't give you the cheesy satisfaction.Other than that.....keep up the good work pizza hut Banashankari!!!"
4,"Nice place.. of course parking is an issue.. canÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât help.. but I would recommend this place for seafood and also vegetarians can accompany.. nice ambiance.. no fish smell around.. good veg options.. family place.. we ordered spl fish thali.. fish ghee roast, fish tawa fry, neer dosa, mushroom ghee roast etc.. I recommend thali.. it is complete meal.. also ghee roast is a must.."
5,"Wonderful lip smacking snack items. Asha sweets centre is bang on Gandhi bazaar road and has a good variety of sweets, savouries, snacks. We went for the samosa and kachori and I must say they are really delicious and worth it. The size of the two were a bit on the smaller side but nevertheless good. Looking forward to revisit"
1,Worst place !! I bot 3 chiroti and asked him to pack 3 Jodhpur ki ladoo with it!!! He package Moti chur ji ladoooo !! How can we eat chiroti with Jodhpur ki ladooo!! This is the worst place ever !!! I purchased this for my parents and travelling almost across the City n see this! Worst place ever!! Very very unhappy!!
4,Good sweet!Sweet are freshValue for moneyNice ambianceOrdered rasmalai sweet and kulfi it was very nice and samosa kachori are also good..We will visit once again...
3,I was here for a quick grab. Asha sweets extension is a dharshini outlet. I had rawa idli and curd Vada. Rawa idli was dry and chutney was not that great. Sagu was good. Curd Vada was the worst I ever had!I would not recommend this restaurant.
3,"Seems like a good place to eat North Indian food. It is a sweet shop, sadly couldnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât get a chance to try out their sweets. Overall its an OK place.:D:IBest RegardsAarihant Malliah"
1,"I had been here yesterday and parceled Basundi two cups with some cake and mixture. While the other things were very good in quality unfortunately Basundi had gone bad. The sales person had parceled the spoilt sweet. I called up the store to complain and the cashier spoke to me and was not ready to accept that the sweet might have gone bad. He was a bit rude answering my questions. I had called up just to inform so that other customers don't get cheated. Maybe the store should not offer such delicacy as parcel in the future. ,My experience in this particular instance was not good."
3.5,"A variety of sweets available here is really rich, the cost is little on the higher side, but the quality of the product is really worth mentioning! Been to its 2-3 outlets, quality is equal across all stores!! Worth a try :)"
3.5,One of the best sweet shop franchise...loads of varieties with fresh stock round the clock..yummy tasty sweets and snacks...had brought sweets(moti chur laddu) for my birthday to my office...the sweets were so fresh that we tried to pick them up from the box..they dispersed...they were out of stock instantly..everyone just loved them..it compliments galore...Now the Report Card:TASTE: 4/5AMBIENCE: 3.5/5 (No much seating capacity)SERVICE: 5/5PRICE: 3.5/5All-in-all a very good experience...absolutely go back again place...
4,The sweets and chaat is really good here. Must try for badam milk lovers :) The quality of all the dishes is up to the mark . It's right next to the mysore mylari hotel. The dahi puri here is scrumptious . Overall a very good sweet and chaat centre to Vista while on the dvg road or in basvangudi :)
3.5,"Asha Sweets is one of the popular sweet shop chains in Bangalore. It started in Malleshwaram and it is famous for some of the Signature sweets. I visited multiple times for their Cold Badam Milk, it truly refreshes especially during summer. Folks are friendly and attentive! I will recommend this place.bangaloreepicure.com"
3.5,"This is the branch of the legendary sweet meats store originally from Malleswaram. I have been visiting this place since years now to have their ""badam milk"" on a regular basis now.More details later on"
5,"It's the perfect place in Basvangudi for short eats.They have Chinese, Chaats, Momos, Potato on Stick, Pizza, Pasta..etcWe end up here quite often.Our favorites are Pasta (yummiest) , Cheese Garlic Bread, Paneer 65.The prices are so Pocket Friendly and total value for money.There's just road side seating, which adds to the whole experience.I guarantee u'll leave d place with a happy foodie smile?"
3,This is a place just near the National College.Peri Peri Twisticks & Jain Twisticks is what I could have. It was spicy and I could not have more.I think this place can be explored more. Try visiting.
3,"Ordered from here for the first time. This place is quite close to my house but was in no mood to go out so ordered through zomato only. Got the delivery in time and it was hot also. Had ordered mushroom pepper, fries with mayonnaise, mixed sauce pasta and tava pallav.Mushroom pepper was too crispy could not even make out whether it was mushroom or baby corn or potato. Fries was decent, pasta was good and tava pallav was average.Would like to visit the place and try there once as the ones we ordered was average."
4,This is one of the lovely place to have good Chinese. Not only chinese but others dishes are quite tasty. I recommend you to try triple schezwan fried rice and cheese garlic bread. Both taste amazing. One of the famous dish of this place is their twiststicks. Try any dish in here you'll not be disappointed. It's pocket friendly as well so if you are in money crunch no problem you can visit this place.I would rate this place 4.5/5.I just wish Zomato gets the old rating system back .
4,"This place has really good masala dosa, it is known for it. I've been here a lot of times, especially to have their specials on various days. Everyday they have a special rice item, which again is a delight."
4,"Looking for a quick and tasty bite, then this is the place to go. A hygienic self serving restaurant which is open throughout the day and serving awesome dosas, sandwiches, Icecreams and chaats.For breakfast they have sandwiches, dosas n akki rotti too, JuiceÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs are available always too.They have a huge variety of dosas, masala, set, onion, capsicum, veg n rawa dosa!!Masala dosa, rava dosa, pongal, butterscotch milkshake, butter fruit juice are few of my favorites here!Service is pretty fast but you ll have to wait a bit during peak hours"
5,One of the best breakfast places!We just love their masala dosa and filter coffee!The dosa is served with two types of chutney which is very flavourful!The rice bath is the best when they serve pulao!I would recommend the akki rotti if you are health conscious!Their set dosa and onion dosa is also really good!Best filter coffee and their juices and sandwiches are also very good.
4,"Went here for dinner and since I wanted to have something light, ended up having Ragi Dosa. Wanted to experiment a bit since this was my first time visting this hotel and also trying Ragi Dosa was in iteself was an experience for me. Well must say I wasn't disappointed. It was very good and the chutney that's given along with it compliments the taste. It costs 45/- which I think is priced on the higher side, but then this not being a regular fare I felt it was ok.. You get 2 Ragi Dosa's in a plate and it's quite filling. I again visited the next morning and needless to say I had the same dosa and it was good.. Good one guys!!"
5,"This is just a minute away from my place . So glad to have a veg place for pizzas , sandwiches and burgers... the hosts are so friendly .. the pizzas are prep fresh .. straight from the oven ?I had their pizza mane spl pizza with cucumber , capsicum, onion , tomato, cheese, paneer ?Tasted brilliant and flavourful ! Pic uploaded in images section... they have small and medium base pizzas too.. Shall visit for more pizzas ? ? Good going guys"
4,Great place for team lunch. Well placed buffet food. Cool ambience. Good varieties. You can find live counter chats as well as deserts too. Marshmallow also available. Food tastes really good. Veg and non veg.
5,I went there for team lunch ... chutney chang is a huge place for buffet .... they have a corporate look... they have a wide variety of Indian and Chinese cuisine .... they have a wide range of stater and main course and everything was perfect ....
5,"Essentially the og of Bangalore buffet restaurant, never gets old nor dose it innovate too much , keeps things calm and simple. It's just plain comfortable. Cool place."
3,"Ambience 7/10Food Quantity 9/10Food Quality 7/10Service 7/10If you're looking for a large spread buffet in Jayanagar this is the place to go. I've been to thier other location in church street and the quality of the food is the same.They have a large variety with live dimsum, starters, pasta, chatt, Chinese and a whole lot more. Even if you try just a little of everything you'll probably be full.All the food is good. It isn't exactly amazing but its not bad. This place is perfect for a big get together or celebration because everyone will get something that they like. I don't see myself going here for any other reason.I would rate this restaurant 7/10"
5,variety for main course ... not only for non-vegetarian even for vegetarian also... 2-3 starters item are there.. the main attraction is chocolate fountain and marshmallow...i loved it so much.. good ambience .. so overall its amazing..
1,"Been there with a group of friends on one of the weekend for dinner buffet. I would like to say the dinner spread was good but were lacking vegetarian options. The food was okay okay types not worth the money they were charging for. I dont know what was mixed in the food as we all fell our stomach in discomfort after eating a little. I would not suggest anyone to go to this place as it is not was it used to be. They had lowered the standards like anything. Dimsums were not having fillings inside them, veg gravies were tasteless and rice were not that great (there were 3 varieties of rice). They only thing good was live chat counter and the person who was singing ( really sounded like Kumar Shanu).The experience was a total led down."
3,"Visited the place since it had such high ratings for buffet. Located on the corner turning towards 4th block, on the 1st floor of the building. Old building, valet parking available. Honestly it is a very average restaurant. At the end of the buffet not a single dish stood out to me. Started off with soup which was horrible . Barely any flavours. The starters both veg and nonveg were just okayish .The chicken dum biryani and the chicken gravy was good. My dad liked the mutton gravy. Paneer tikka was the worst dish we had . Dimsums were also very average. Paneer tikka was hard , rubbery. My mother loved the rasam rice. Apparently it was very flavourful. Dessert section they had a wide variety but again nothing stood out. Affordable price at 600/head."
4,"One of the biggest buffet spread in Bangalore.Ambience : 4/5A nice, classy hygienic ambience.Food : 4/5A large spread, but most of the things were really oily. Really good desserts as well.Service : 4/5Waiter was well trained and available.Veg friendly? 4/5Lot of vegetarian stuffs.Visit again? Probably yes."
5,"Amazing and fulfilling visit. Great ambience, food and service. Too much spoilt for choice. Thanks.Liked the mutton biryani and the desserts a lot. Even chat was sumptuous! Prompt service and so much variety. I am just gearing up to eat there again."
3,"Out of random came across the excutive veg thali of this place and must say the quantity and variety was amazing..Paneer tikka and babycorn chilli were as starters.veg biryani ,naan ,palakpaneer,raita and gulab jamun.the quantity was good for two people in one thali..impressed with the variety..the taste of paneer and babycorn could have been better.rest all was good!"
4,"I've never visited the outlet but have ordered from Chutney Chang a fair number of times *more than I'd care to admit* The variety offered for the non veg meal is remarkable. The quality and quantity of food has never disappointed and for a person who's eaten his fair share from this outlet, they are, it anything else, consistent. I'd definitely recommend a visit or take out from this restaurant. They will not disappoint."
2,Ordered from this place on a weekday evening. Delivery was on time and packaging was ok. We ordered chicken lollipops (bad) and Chicken Burnt garlic rice (ok). The sauce given with chicken was too spicy. Overall:Food - 2/5Delivery - 4/5Vfm - 3/5
4,excellent food with extremely quick service. will crave you to go there next. chicken thukpa and momos are must try and the box concept is great and filling.
5,Perfect for Street side college time hang out experience .There are 5-6 food joints in the same lane. Food is too good and so is the price .
3,I ordered from this place through zomato.The delivery was quick with neat packaging.We had ordered noodles along with veg balls in manchurian gravy. The veg balls were delectable and had just the required spiceness .However the noodles was bland and did not taste as good as expected. It was quite a disappointment for the price they charge.
3,"I ordered for a veg meal combo through Zomato, seeing all the positive reviews about this place. I am usually picky about where I eat Chinese, but made an exception.The meal was delivered to me in a nice packaging within 40 minutes of ordering. It had 2 small pieces of veg momos (I could feel that was stuffed with cabbage), a manchurian (I couldnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât recognise which one that was, I think it was a mix veg thingy).The gravy they gave with the rice looked/tasted like how it would if a dal makhani is mixed with Szechuan sauce, but surprisingly tasted ok.In the box, there was some veg Hakka noodles along with veg fried rice, which were ok. (The fried rice was dry as it could ever be, though)The meal was VFM.Note to the restaurant: Please look into special cooking instructions. I had asked the dishes to be made spicy and it was conveniently ignored (-1 for that)Would I try food from here again? probably yes, to give them another chance and see how their a la carte tastes like!"
4,Wonderful little place that serves good food. The Chicken Thukpa is mouth watering and the prices are very reasonable. Must try for any Chinese food lover.
5,I had ordered with Zomato.The food is awesome..Pan fried monos.. egg noodles and chicken ball Manchurian...The quality of chicken is great. Melts in mouth. Loved the whole experience.Thanks.
3,Pocket friendly and quick service.But i dint like the taste. We tried momos and soup.both were very ok.many items there will try again. Located in the busy streets of jayngar.
2,I ordered a veg combo meal..The packing was nicely done.The rice was completely bland..noodles were still good enough..Momo also were good!!
4,After seeing it's reviews thought of giving it a try. I had ordered Special lunch box and veg pasta for lunch.The packing was good and delivery was earlier as well. Pasta was yummm n hot. Coming to the combo noodles and momos was good. Paneer fried rice was bland and paneer manchurian had become hard.Quantity was good enough for the price. It's pocket friendly :) we can give it a try.. I loved the pasta properly cooked n the sauce was also yummm
4,"I have only tried their Chicken Manchurian and it was tasty??From the beverage section, I tried blue lime which was refreshing..?Will definitely visit again!!"
5,"After going thru the reviews, decided to head out to this place for dinner. Tucked away in one of the bylanes of 4th Blk Jayanagar. Must say I was quite impressed with what I saw. Small little place and yet manages to attract the crowd. First thing's first.  I Opted to go for take away and ordered Schezwan Momo's, Paneer Thupka and Paneer Fried rice. As far as the staff is concerned, they are courteous, polite and everything that you would want to see in 'em. Got the stuff home and started digging to satiate my hunger. Momos were awesome and have no complaints with it. Paneer thupka is a flat noodle soup with a lot of veggies. That was filling. Tried their Paneer fried rice and must say it was nice. I had requested them to make it with less oil and boy they were quite serious about it. They made it with less oil just like the way I like it. Awesome taste and surely a must visit again. Besides, it's pocket-friendly too!!  Glad I ended up here."
4,This place is very close to my house. Went here for lunch with my family.This place is small but clean and appealing. It stands out during the night with all the lights lit up. It looks fabulous.Service is good. Staff is busy and occupied but they do suggest what's good and how much is sufficient.Food is very good. This place is a must for vegetarians if they don't mind shelling some extra bucks. Everything we ordered was delicious. Baby corn tandoori item and the veg kheema gravy were the best in the lot. I still remember the taste.They do have buffet. I always like a la carte as the food is our choice and not from restaurant.A thumbs up from me.P.S - the lift does not work
4,Our experience was a pleasant one. Food was tasting good though the service was very late. We enjoyed the food right from starter to main course. Can visit once for dinner or lunch. Try Indian cuisines is what I recommend.Price:3/5Food:4/5Quality:4/5Quantity:4/5Ambiance:2/5(too clumsy and noisy)Service:2/5(very slow)
3,"It was just the name which made me to visit this restaurant.Thamboola is a kannada word which depicts symobol of something good happening whereas it's a cocount given as something good to happen and often offered to gods.Well coming to this restaurant,I must say ambience is pretty good.Food was very much spicy than expected.Tomato soup didn't had much salt in it which made us to crave for that at the beginning itself.Rest of the food was not bad !!! Would like to visit the other franchise sanchurro which serves italian some time soon.Ambience : 3.5/5Vfm : 3/5Food : 3/5"
3,"A nice family restaurant well located in Banashankari. The food was authentic North Indian perhaps one of the best I had but it's low on hygiene for the price we pay.We had ordered paneer butter masala and Bhindi do pyaza for the main course. A bunch of butter naans,lacha paratha and butter kulcha.The naan is pretty big compared to other restaurants so be careful if you are ordering more.Both the currys were excellent and the naan was soft and smooth.But the tables and glasses are dirty. They have a mat on their table which is filled with dirt and hasn't been cleaned for years. The glasses have stains on them too.Overall the food prices r lesser when compared to other restaurants offering the same quality food.They have a buffet too.Food: 8/10Ambience:7/10Prices:8/10"
4,"It's a pretty good place to be in, the ambience is peaceful, the service is clean and apt. The food tastes great and they have quite a few varieties. It's economical and worth it."
1,"The ambience is good. However, the tables r not cleaned properly and looks very ugly n unhygienic. Service is very poor and need lot of improvement. The description of food doesnt match the food that is served. Glasses look very beautiful but food particles can be seen inside it. It's high time to change the injes of restroom doors."
3,"The ambiance as visible from the road below is the reason why I wanted to try this place. Went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.There was a buffet on offer for 299+taxes which I choose to not take and instead went for a la carte.Here are the details on the order and how they stacked up.Paneer Tikka: Soft an flavourful, 8/10Cashew and Dhaniya Pulao: Very buttery with loads of cashews. 7/10Veg Jhalfrazy: A regular tomato based mixed veg gravy. 6/10Disappointing that on a Saturday afternoon they did not have most of the option for deserts. The only one available was gulab jamun which I choose to skip.Overall a decent experience."
4,Soup and starters are very good. Main course was ok ok.. deserts were also good.. Average ambiance.. restaurant is well situated near to Devegowda Petrol Bunk and KIMS.
4,"Good place, great ambience, good food, family type, good service.happy vijayadashami folks.And happy birthday mywifey.First time visit- ordered soup, babycorn manchurian, panner recepie, some kulchas and 2type curries finally curd rice all were good."
3,"Heard about this restaurant from a friend, so taught of trying it, placed an order on zomato as it was within the delivery range... Food was decent nothing great, value for price.."
5,"A great place for dine-in.The ambience is just perfect with yellow lights and red glasses.The staff are very courteous and prompt.We went there for dinner on a Monday night and still the place gradually filled up in no time.For starters, we tried the spring rolls which was just mouth-watering and too yummy.Next,for main course,we ordered veg kolapuri and butter naan.The naan had generous amount of butter but the show stealer was veg kolapuri. It was simply outstanding and really made our day.Looking forward to many more visits to try out their curries."
4,"Namaste !I recently visited thamboola in banashankari . The place is small , cosy and has a very nice ambiance . The service was also good .The food here is mostly north Indian and Chinese.So for the appetizersWe took tandoori babycorn and tandoori aloo and Gobi . Both the dishes had the same marination and tasted good served with green Chutney and salad.For the main courseWe took american corn noodles and veg biryani . The biryani tasted good which was served with raita but the American noodles was not that great . It dint have the wow factor !! Also the forks were not clean .Overall the place serves some good food . A pocket friendly place !!Food - 3.5 /5Ambiance- 4/5Service - 4/5"
5,"Thamboola a place were dinner was delicious. Qantity and quality food was good. Basket of roti was enough to fill tummy of two people. Staff was co-operative , ambiance was not that decorative but the taste really matters which was good."
1,Very bad experience staff are very rude and not friendlyWe very not even given a chance to see the menu the manager was not interestedAs we were in a hurry we told we IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâll have half portion and the the other half take away or parcel for which he denied and said we Do not a have half and half parcel policy so when asked what are you going to do with the leftover he said we put it to the trashWhich was the disappointment so we decided not to eat and walked out
4,"Castle Rock have a nice theme, its ambience is of cave and garden with bamboo sticks. Awesome place to take some cool pics.The price is competitively cheap when compared to other restaurants. Total worth the price. The quality of food and quantity is also good. Best place to hangout with friends in private cave table.We had ordered fish fingers, dragon chicken, chicken drum sticks, Biryani, prawn Manchurian.Service should have improved. Other than that everything is good.They have like cool hand wash area where the water flows from rocks."
3,"Avg ambience , avg food , good service.Frankly most of the food lacked the flavour punch and tasted bland.Had the raw papaya salad the papaya was very coarse and unevenly cut. The beans that were added were very hard and chewy. The sauce was good but lacked the punch.Same with the gobi butter garlic fry. Felt like gobi manchurian thatÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs been toned down a notch.The pho is very filling and can be shared by two to three folks.The only good part the portion sizes are really big and hearty."
4,"Truely good food. Authentic,nice and flavoursome was my experience. 2 times I visited both the times food was really yummy as well as their hospitality was great. Prompt service and caring attitude of the staffs what make you feel truely great. I ordered burnt garlic rice, chicken red and green, chicken glass noodles soup and hot garlic fish (dry) apart from the fish dish I liked most of the dishes. Taste and Quantity in both these parameters they scored very nicely.Visit surely ??"
4,"Good place for South East Asian food near my house. Simple menu. Tasty food. Service is not too quick, not too slow. Can visit when you're craving for noodles or fried rice."
2,"Easy to spot, cornered and naturally brightly lit place.The ambience is nice with a wide spread of tables, service is quick and the waiters are polite.Food is a let down. Not really Vietnamese.Lemon coriander soup, Papaya Salad was just edible.Molten chocolate cake had nothing molten about it.Simple place, nothing fancy.Not sure would go back. Place ha a potential and can do better."
3,It is very close to the Deve Gowda petrol bunk & located on the first plot in the lane after Axis Bank.The decor is nice & the staffs are courteous.We ordered for Mekong Fried Rice (mixed) & Hot & Spicy Chicken on the advice of the staff serving us.The Hot & Spicy chicken was unlike anything oriental I had ever eaten & did more than justice to its name. The fried rice was lumpy but didn't taste bad either.
4,"Really loved the glass noodles, this is something I havenÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât tried before. Properly cooked but bit of oily, this is the reason I cut one star rating for the review. Vet. Non veg fried rice was well cooked and mixed with Chicken, tiny Prawns and and tasty and it was well worth the price."
3,A restaurant with basically nothing Vietnamese in it. It's just another Chinese restaurant around the block. The place was bustling with people around dinner time. The food we ordered was good but again contrary to as expected nothing Vietnamese. Portions were good and service was prompt. Prices were also fair enough. just about an average place.
4,"Had been for dinner date with Ajay Babu after a while. Good place to have peaceful dinner. Tried their varieties of Cuisines. Enjoyed Rice flour Rolls and Glass Noodles with veggies to the core. Must try for rolls and glass noodles...Price:4/5Quality:4/5Quantity :4/5Service:3/5( Suggestion: the team can be trained in serving, they are scared while serving the dish.)Ambiance:4/5Food:4/5"
3,"Cozy place.. parking can be a bit pain.. food is average except for some. Service is slow .. we tried multiple options.. especially we liked seafood soup, Red curry, jasmine tea, darshan with ice cream. Overall decent place."
3,Wanted to try Vietnamese cuisine for a long time and finally landed up here.Food : we tried chicken hot and sour soup which was good.The green papaya salad with chicken that we tried was fantastic and tasted kinda sweet and a had pieces of pan friend chicken.Mushroom manchurian that we had was not thar great and was too soggy and salty.And finally the main course was viet kitchen fried rice which was not great though.There ambience is descent and they provide good service.
4,"I visited this place with my friend for lunch last week. It's very easy to spot. It has a decent ambience.Food: we orderedveg dumpling: the filling tasted good, but the outer layer got hard very quickly and it became difficult to cut through.Chocolate Molten Lava cake with ice cream: this was the BEST dish on their menu. The cake itself was extremely side and bouncy. It literally bounced! It was the perfect sweet ( not to sweet or bitter). The ice cream that was served with it was good too. The molten chocolate was simply delicious. It's a MUST HAVE.Vietnamese sandwich called BaÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå±h MÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâåÂ : this was my first time eating this, surprising it was very yummy. It had a great and unique flavor, and bread itself was quite unique.Crispy chili basil Gobi: this dish was like a regular Gobi Manchurian, It didn't have any extraordinary taste, infact it could have been better.Service: decent service, kind staff members, a bit slow. Overall good."
1,"The place itself looks decent, with courteous and smiling waiters. But alas, thatÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs where it ends!I ordered for a Thai chilli basil fried rice and a babycorn in black pepper sauce to take away.The menu says the fried rice is spicy and I ask them to make it spicier, with the babycorn in black pepper sauce to be a spicy gravy too. What I got was a garlicky moosh for fried rice which even my 3 year old daughter was able to eat (bland) and the biggest surprise was that I was given dry vegetables and not the gravy!When I called back to complain, the guy very politely told me that the kitchen was closed and apologised. He also told me that I could actually have my fried rice without the gravy too :) . This is when I had to tell him that the fried rice was in edible and hence, I was calling.Overall, very disappointed."
3,"It really sucks to give 3 star to Vietnamese kitchen but I was so disappointed after having such high expectations.To be clear, service was good but the food was average....borderline mediocre. They do not have shumai even though its listed in the menu and the momo's had a chewy- hard texture. Pho taste was too bland. The broth had no depth of texture or tatse, more like some vegetable and chicken boiled in water with salt and pepper. Lost interest and didn't order the main course.#zomatogold helped. Chicken Pho and Veg momo's came to 490 and zomatogold reduced it down to 310 something.My mind is against visiting again even though my heart so wants to...."
4,Authentic Vietnamese food available here. Perfect blend of flavour and spices in the food specially the Vietnam kitchen noodles and the chicken momos. For the vegetarian lovers the mushroom and baby corn will just go quite well.
2,"Located by the main road, this place is easy to spot because of their huge sign board.The ambience is not very good. The staff is polite but service is a little slow.I ordered crispy black peppercorn chicken, Chu chee curry and Viet kitchen noodles. All were very average in terms of taste and portion sizes were less."
5,"Awesome place for hang out. Peri peri twisto, white sauce pasta, corn cheese pizzas are a MUST try. They have a lot of other varieties too. Small place but very good food."
5,"Value for the money, yummy taste, loved the food..... Quantity is not as expected, but quality over took that.... Took some extra time but worth waiting for the same...."
2,not good as expected. at least didn't meet minimum expectation
5,Good taste. Delivered on time. Worth the money....................................................................................................................
2,everything has become too soft
1,Disappointed... Big time.!!!
1,tasted bad
1,Today I don't like very bed I like C corner but today very bad tqu zomato
2,not nice ...it is not hot..
5,"food taste was really good , but for the price , the pizza is very small , it's actually a palm size one!! , but the quality made up for the quantity!!"
4,good job
3,pizzas are good but sandwich are not at all good
4,Give extra sos
1,Worst waste of money...no taste of food at all
1,Don't order Pizza sandwich here. Tastes like shit.Had maida powder in my mouth. Looked like Pizza had some pneumonia attack. Don't fall for the fancy shit here.
4,"These guys have some tasty local snacks of bangalore.. Had ordered nippat masala burger,sangam masala, Grilled sandwich with olives.. al these dishes were gud.. veg n Olive sandwich stole my heart..? it came vt generous amout of cheese, vegetables n olives! N its must try frm der menu.."
4,"From this place, my experience is only through zomato online food order. Only reason for repeat order of five times is their taste. Very homely food preparation n taste. Somehow, everytime I end being hungry and never managed to take a picture of the for served. Will surely do it on my next order. Pulka dhal and aloo jeera is served for rs.99 on zomato and it is really worth the money. All the very best team, keep it going...... !"
1,"We ordered phulkas, dal and paratha last night for dinner. Both husband and me are sick today down with food poisoning. Please check your food quality."
2,"Ordered food through zomato. the prices are inexpensive. Phulkas, Missi roti and veg kohlapuri were all average. felt like I could cook better. Order at your own risk."
2,"Ok ok place , ordered veg biryani with combo of coke but did not recieve the coke at all. Even the biryani was also not good it was litterly like tomato rice with small quantity"
1,Ordered 2 Thali online but received only one.. Zomato didn't help either.. Worst experience.. Food quality and taste were below average.. Dissapointed..
5,Nice food in very reasonable price . It's like pocket friendlyRestaurant in southend circle .all food made typical naati style.........................Its adjusted between bar. Overall good........ I will recommend this place.
1,Avoid! Avoid! The new management that took over is money minded they jacked up the prices but the quality has gone down a lot! The previous owner was really nice and humble!
4,"Saturday Night DinnerBaked JalapeÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå±os - The pungency of the JalapeÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå±os was remarkable just enough to tingle the senses and yet subtleToscana Signature Goat Cheese Salad - this is one phenomenal must try Salad. Every element is perfect. Be it the beets, the apple, the apricot of the greens.Shiraz Rose Wine - this wine was quite dry and the bouquet was greatFettuccine with English Vegetables - the Vegetable were cooked to perfection yet the fettuccine was downright disappointment though the manager did come up and offer a replacement.Overall surely I would go back again. Second visit in 3 days."
4,Ten years old chain of restaurants and one of best among their cuisine I guess!Spread in ground and first floor with good seating capacity and great ambience friendly service and a vast menu.Surely worth a visit.
5,"From what I tasted of the salad, they were brilliant and a place that serves good salad is always good. A complete review will follow shortly."
3,Average food. Did not particularly enjoy the experience as the food was bland and average. The pizzas are really good though. The pasta and the risotto that I had was very flavourless.
4,"I really loved the ambience. The hospitality was really nice. Tried one of their creamy pasta, loved the creaminess of the pasta though I wish the pasta should have been a bit more cooked. Overall the place is really good."
5,Never been disappointed with this place.. Be it hospitality or the food.. It's open all thru and so good food anytime :) we went at 4. 30pm for our lunch on a sunday and has a sumptuous meal.. their pizzas are thin crust and loaded with toppings.. My friend loved her chicken salad.. Tried the mulled wine speciality of Christmas season and was happy.. Slightly on the higher range on price but worth it..
5,This was my first visit to Toscano and it was an amazing experience.The service was top notch from the beginning to end.Tried the Chicken Barbeque Pizza and it was an absolute delight! (And the toppings are customizable)The ambience is amazing and the food was legit Italian.Just one request.You could really work on the playlist as the songs didn't really match up to the ambience and food.Great experience overall!Special thanks to Mr. Biswas for great service.
4,"Quiet and beautiful ambiance . Amazing for a peace loving person.We love this place for the italian food they offer.We had -Mozarella and zucchini fritti - 3.5/5Margherita pizza - 4/5Quattro formaggi - 4/5Sphagetti aglio olio - 4.5/5Farfelle con formaggio - 4.5/5Overall, the food was good, if not great.I found the forum mall toscano to be better than this one."
4,This is definitely a place for thin crust pizzas. Indeed amazingly huge pizza with a crust which is appreciable. The ambience and service is also good.
4,Ambience 8/10Food 9/10Service 8/10Very close to Ashoka Pillar this restaurant is the first restaurant that comes to mind if you want to have a good classy meal anywhere in the Jayanagar area. Toscano is really great for a date night or just for some food food.They have other locations across the city and the standard of the food is the same everywhere. The restaurant is quite posh and a great place to get some good Italian food. I would highly recommend the chocolate mousse dessert and the pizzas. They are really good at almost everything they do and so you can't really go wrong with what you order.The service is also very good and helpful. You are assured a good meal and a nice experience when you visit Toscano.
4,"A nice place for pizzas and pastas. Reached this place around 8 pm, got a place to seat immediately. The ambience of this place , be it koramangla, jayanagar , UB city or Orion mall, has always been very nice.Coming to the food , ordered a broccoli soup and rustica pizza. The soup was brilliant but pizza became soggy within some time.In short a 3.5 * rating for me , a plus .5 for the zomato gold."
4,This place is situated at Jayanagar 3rd Block. This place is always a favourite for Italian dishes. The food here is great and menu also looks amazing. We had tried the spinach Risotto and the crispy chicken. The risotto was average all the other dishes were great. Good ambienceFood - 4/5Staff -4/5Ambience-4/5
5,"Awesome food.Being a north indian,this is what i look for,in banglore. Best place to order, for all north indian food lovers...All the best team..."
5,Very good quantity of butter chicken and even taste was good. Delivery time was also very less . Overall everything was at reasonable price.
5,"Awesome packing , great taste, with huge quantities...I basically like fresh food not frozen or kept food in fridge to prepare ...I would like to thank kitchen team as food was fresh and charm,i would definitely recommend friends for this place..faster delivery ...keep it up..will be ordering again soon ?"
5,Great food and industry standard quality. Recommended to order veg and non veg delicacies atleast once to get a better idea. I would definitely go for another order to Lord of Kitchen.
5,Loved the Maharaja thali here :-) I was in Bangalore and ordered it.. it was worth every penny... Loved the joint... Please try...the service was prompt and courteous.. professional guys.. all the best
5,Very nice food and packaging.. must have Maharaja thali... Delicious taste and the packing was so good that I received the rice and roti steaming hot when it reached my place.. gonna try more dishes from here... Kudos bros!!
5,"""Lord of the kitchen "" is indeed a food hub that does justice to it's title , pocket friendly and serves mouth watering dishes.I tried the Maharaja thali (non veg) ,it's one of the best Indian thalis that I have ever had , regular dishes given an extraordinary edge.Guys have food from this place and add spice to your life !!!!"
5,Authentic cousin and good mix of spices. Reasonable and many options to chose from. Packing is tight and delivery is real quickPrabodh Hend Ekta Mutyalwar Anagha Menachery
4,Had been here on and off. Enjoyed the way they do the Icecream... the taste is also maintained well and after renovations he prices has changed but I feel so that the prices quoted are worth the food they serve the customers.Good luck team Stoned Monkey...Enjoyed their customised ice creams to a great extent. Ajay Babu
4,Ambience:4/5Taste: 4/5quantity:5/5Quality: 4/5Price:3/5Stoned Monkey is a wonderful experience to be in.. The preparation and presentation with add-ons is a delight to people of any age( especially for childrens). There is lots of variety to choose from in the menu and each one is unique. Seatings can be improved. Ample parking space. A tad bit overpriced. Enjoy!
4,"The ice creams here are good, provided you choose the right flavor. Chocolate has always been a safe option. It's a bit expensive, but worth for the cold stone ice cream they give."
4,Loved the crazy jar of milk shake ..brownie chunks... Chocolate sticks...whip cream.... Chocolate syrup...red velvet pastrie...Oreo cookie...and oh yum oh yum
4,Itz really good for authentic north Indian food. Especially their rotis and vegetable gravies. Paneer kohlapuri and schzwan baby corn are my favourites.
4,"It's not a restaurant. It's an experience. Food is good. Service too. Considering jail theme, ambience is perfect...kinda gloomy. I won't go again. But, yea worth a visit to experience."
4,After long time visited a new restaurant and it has very different theme. As you can see the name it is themed to give a feel of prison. All the staff are dressed as cops and inmates. Even the cutlery they use reflected that ambience. Even the food is great!!!Food in pictures: Prawn Hakka style fried rice and Red alert ( A boneless chicken starter)Totally worth visiting once
3,"Been for weekend dinner with prior booking. As we were 4 adults had booked a table for 4 & upon reaching, looking at the kids staff behaved very rude & spoke nonsense saying you should have booked including kids or left the kids at home. Which certain made me angry & asked them to take the kids back home look after them until we return after dinner. I agree weekends are crowded but I didn't expect them to be rude just for that. Apart from that it was fairly a good eat out. Everything we tried were good."
5,"Central Jail is a prison-themed restaurant in Jayanagar market. Although, the concept is not new and there are a couple of more prison-themed restaurants that I had visited in different cities a couple of years ago. However, the taste of food is really superb!I would say that this is a hidden gem in the Jayanagar market and it's going to be my one-stop dining destination going forward whenever I am in Jayanagar market for shopping.I ordered a Dragon Chopsuey, a Butter Garlic Chopsuey, Veg Kofta, and Garlic Naan. The taste and quality of food was awesome!Ambience was just perfect and the staff was polite and courteous. Overall, a satisfying experience."
5,"Unique themed Restaurant with Good Food !!!!Visited the place recently with my office colleagues.The Restaurant is located in the main road near Jayanagar Shopping complex.Entire place is themed like a Central Jail.Jailers taking orders, Prisoners serving food, Tables inside prison cells etc etc.Each prison cell can accommodate only 4 people , so if you are going in a big group you will have to sit outside the prison cell.I am a pure Vegetarian so i can comment only on Veg Food.The Food was very good.The prices are little on the higher side.But if you want a different experience, it should not be a matter.Totally worth a visit."
4,"Visited the place with my family which is located in the prime location of Jayanagar 4th block. As the name says the ambience is in the jail format with 4-5 cells and few regular tables but somewhere I felt ambience incomplete. I would give 3* for ambience. The main part is the taste,cost and quantity. Taste of the food makes us to visit again as well s the quality price is bit expensive side. Staffs are friendly and into quick service. Over all worth visiting, keep up the good work."
1,This review is for hospitality more than food..just dropped in today with lot of anticipation as this was in my bucket list for long ..so I landed only to know that the place was closed ..as door was open I just went in to enquire if we can waite as there was 2 Min..for opening ..but bang come a person and way he shooed us out and banged door on our face and tone with which he said das minute Baad aavo..just gave me n my friend truly central jail experience.. will think twice before I get booked or locked up in this place again ...
3,"Themed restaurants have always been a great source of attraction and enjoyment, the rate at which these restaurants have been coming up over the past year is astonishing. IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâve seen somewhere around five of them popping up! ranging from cars, trucks and caves. This time what caught my fantasy was a restaurant themed as a prison! ...Read full post on rajeevabasavaraju.wordpress.com"
3,As the name suggests interiors is based on Prison cell.Food is served in Al Plates as in Prison.Ordered Chicken Kshatriya in starters. It's A Semi dry dish. Leg pieces with dash of gravy. Taste is okay but can be better.In the main course go for the Chicken Encounter which is quite different & very tasty. It's Chicken cooked & wrapped in Omelette with rich tomato gravy. With Tandoori Roti is a good combination.Ghee rice was well cooked with dry fruits in it. Tasted good with the curries & tastes even more better when eaten by hand.Lime soda was also good with sweet & salt mixture balanced well.Staff are courteous & watch out for their attire which is quite different from the traditional bearers attire.
4,"This is a not much known place in jayanagar. This has a good coastal menu in it. I would say a good peaceful place with simple n cute ambience. Looking at the seafood special menu I tried prawn sukks, appam, chicken pulimunchi, need dosa and sannas which is nothing but the normal idli. All tasted good and so was the service. A family type restaurant and would like to visit again."
1,"Horrible is not the word for service and food at this place. This place isnt sweet as Bella, but bitter like bevu. They messed up the order food was tasteless, we had to wait for over an hour just to get our food and drinks. Lime juice tasted like plain water, chicken ghee roast was pathetic and mutton biryani was uncooked and tasted horrible. I can't understand how a restaurant can run with such bad food and service. To top it all the food was highly priced and all we got was arrogant service. Best is to avoid such a place."
2,"After seeing so much reviews on Zomato, finally tried this hotel.. it's not worth the hype,Orderedprawns masala fry was good..Seer tawa fry & Chicken biryani was worst,Ragi Manni dessert was also very bad"
5,"Bella is an honest celebration of Manglorean cuisine at its core.The decor and ambience is very inviting and homely. The outdoor seating is beautiful!Coming to the food, my favourites are neer dosa/appam, paneer/chicken/prawn/crab ghee roast, the pulimunchi, the vegetable stew, the mutton shorba, ragi manni and the coconut payasam!And of course, the seafood is mind blowing!The food is delicious and very well prepared!So happy that there is another amazing place in jayanagar to have a great lunch/dinner,with family especially."
3,"Bored up with usual pasta pizza and chicken wings? Place here to let ya tongue taste new. A family restaurant located in the prime area of Jayanagar, with a feel of being home. An authentic Mangalore styled food blended with Kerala touch is the major attraction.Chicken ghee roast, pepper chicken, egg pakoda and appam are the must haves, fish fry is equally good.Little pricy when compared to other restaurants round, but isn't a authentic food always comes with a price tag?? :)"
4,"Wanted to give 4.5A deliteful ??????? cuisine place right @ the heart of 11main jayanagarTried egg and chicken ghee roast, anjal masala fry, chicken sukka, egg appam, appam & neer dosa.Ghee roast masala was excellent with the right hints of sweetness and sourness, anjal masala fry could be a lil. More better as masala tasted a little bland, sukka was excellent and the spices really stood out.Loved the egg appam its was damn filling and tasted brilliant with sukka.Would love to come here soon and have more mangalore style dishes."
4,"Despite popular belief, vegetarian food was just brilliant. Paneer ghee roast, babycorn chilli and the best of all the neer dosa! A must visit :)"
4,"One more new authentic Andra resto in Jayanagar for foodies bucket list! We planned to visit this place for dinner tonight! Good place, ambience quite decent, service is quick and very attentive staff ? we ordered chicken fry, garlic naan, butter roti, paneer tikka masala and steam rice.. food was delicious and very spicy food, authentic Andra spices and we enjoyed the food..?"
2,"Hotel is not maintained clean and ventilation is not proper...I liked kamakya outlet ,thought to try in jayanagar, faced total disappointed with quality of food and service...won't suggest to go here..try other outlet bommasandra/kamakya both are maintained well and service is also good..."
3,"Nati oota, which did not taste like there original prashanth at this outlet. Ragi balls were very hard. Okay kind off ambience and budget friendly."
4,All time favorite combo. Ragi balls and mutton chops and this place takes the cake for the best Ragi ball. Soft and no rice mixed. Try it the next time youÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâre in Jayanagar.
3,"It was late afternoon, We missed our lunch and hopped in to ""The Grillo"" at around 5 in the evening.The staffs were friendly but seemed inexperienced. Since it was late, a couple dishes we asked were not available. But we managed to order Neerdose, chicken Sukha and Sholay kebabs.Neerdose was decent, and did tasted good with chicken Sukha. Loved how Sholay kebabs were rolled inside a layer of eggs."
4,"3.5/5This is newly opened Restaurant in jayanagar 4th block opposite to MaiyyaÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs restaurant.It has got normal ambience and the service was little slow inspite of less customers.Coming to the food ,I had chicken manchow soup,crispy chicken and mutton dum biriyani (nati style).Mutton dum biriyani was more spicy.Quantity was good of all the items.Rates are affordable."
5,Good and tasty Malnad style food..worth price again..Special Malnad Kadubu is famous for all season. Go and eat definetly you are loving this restorent with good atmosphere..
5,Super taste and i love to eat Malnad Akki Kadbu/Neer dhosa with fish gravy and This is like fully home made tasteFor all MALNADIGAS good place to have home food and don't miss it.I love it. Thank you
5,"Best place for Malnad ppl to have thier home food,And highly recommend place for foodies who want to try authentic Malenadu (part of karnataka) type of food."
4,This place has personally become my favourite because of the service and the coffee they serve. The cafe is a small place and they have handwritten menus.They have their own coffee brewery so the coffee is pretty great here and the barista serves the coffee with art performed.I wouldn't recommend the hot chocolate though but you can try out the coffee.Another personal favourite of this place is the KARMA FRIES .Do check out this place and let me know about any other thing I could try out in here.
4,"Visited this place yesterday for a quick coffee break and I wasn't disappointed with the taste at all.Ambience is good, but the service is too slow. Also, the price is on the higher side according to the quantity but yes, the variety of coffee they have is mind blowing. And they roast their own beans, so ?It's a must visit.Surely gonna try other varieties next time."
5,"I adore Karma Kaapi ?? it's located in Jayanagar, but slightly away from the hustle and bustle. Formerly called Benki Kaapi, the place is revamped and amazing. The interiors are quirky and inviting. It's a great place to catch up with people or simply nurse a well brewed beverage while working. We ordered two cafe mochas and a corn bhel. The coffee was out of this world, but the bhel could have been better. The prices are on the higher side, but worth it. I can't wait to try out more things from their insanely cute handmade menu. Definitely going back very soon!"
4,"Indian grown, delicious and flavourful coffee.A nice, clean and friendly space.The staff is so friendly and super nice!They will help you choose a coffee and the menu is hand drawn! ?Also three cheers for customising the cold coffee with soy milk for my lactose intolerant friend ??Will surely come back again!"
5,"Five stars for the utter professionalism. Ambience cool, innovative. Coffee out of the world. Madrasi pasta good. They forgot to bring in the cafe Mocha on time, so they didn't charge for it even on constant request to add the amount in the bill. My husband became their fan for truly believing in the name ""Karma"" kaapi"
5,"Totally Loved the ambience, made such good use of a small room and it looks absolutely amazing. Red velvet latte was exclusively great, service was great as well. Its a must try place."
4,Cute and cozy place for some catch up with friends over a coffee. Ambience is nice and looks brighter. Loved their Menu Card which is hand written.Tried1. Red Velvet Latte - Has the perfect amount of red velvet and the sweetness is perfect and presented beautiful and the color of the latte steals the heart.2. Salted Caramel Latte - Because like they said Salt is Life. They give you extra caramel along which indeed is required. Enjoyed every sip of latte with salt.3. Spicy Potato Wedges - I could eat this all day. Perfectly done and the dip served along went well.Totally loved the place. Will visit again to try more.
4,"Whose not a coffee lover in today's world? When u get all ur favorites in one place why go anywhere else. This small warm welcoming cafe is a perfect heaven for those who love brewed coffee. This cafe will brew your coffee in more than 20 ways from all across the world that will make you fall in love with coffee again and again. I visited this cafe recently and tried cold brew, Vietnamese mango coffee, coffee bite coffee, salted caramel latte and iced caramel latte. The cold brew was cold and mild version of black coffee. It's a perfect coffee cooler rare to find anywhere else. Coffee bite and mangoes are one of most loved food items. When get blend with your favorite coffee the result has to be grand. No exaggeration but the Vietnamese mango coffee and coffee bite coffee is all one needs for a good day. Salted caramel latte and iced caramel latte are equally worth sipping down. Had a great experience. Must must try for all out there and you will know there is more to coffee."
3,Ambience is too good even the food tastes delicious ? but the prices are way too high and quantity of food is too less for the price charged ? and the service is tooooooooo slow ? the price of potato pops are Rs - 149 but the quantity of it is not more thn 7 to 8 potato pops ? disappointed
5,"The brightly lit Karma Kaapi was a place IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâd passed by many times making a note to visit, so when I finally did, it was on a rainy Sunday evening. A little space that blends form with function, with a glass wall, little wooden benches and yellow lighting, its quite the perfect nook. One sometimes forgets that visiting a cafe isnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât just about the food and drinks, but an experience - and Karma Kaapi reminds you of it.We had the charcoal latte, the mocha and focaccia sandwich at this vegetarian joint. The charcoal latte, was unlike typical trend-based drinks in the sense that it not only looked Instagram-worthy but was delicious to boot! The mocha had latte art of a piglet - super cute. The sandwich was made well, and had super fresh produce (such a welcome respite).Add to this their well-trained, courteous staff who was able to recommend drinks, we had a great experience here. 10/10 will visit again. Best recommended for smaller groups or couples."
4,"Love going to coffee places and this time I tried something new! I tried red velvet latte and caramel latte. Redvelvet was something new for me. You get that redvelvet taste when you take a sip. It's better to have it when it's hot, If you let it cool down while chit chatting with your friends, it's gonna taste like plain milk! I loved caramel latte. It's just amazing. It's one of my favourite latte. I also tried spicy potato wedges. It was crispy outside and soft inside. I loved the dip.I love their simple ambience. I love how creative they are when it comes to their interior, the lights , table and benches. Friendly staff and not very pricy."
4,Its just awesome!! Located at the opposite of Slimsins restro cafe in Jaynagar!! ?Very small cafe with varieties of caffeine!! And some chats for the drink! Best place for the couples ?Most attractive thing is food Menu designed by pencil writings! And red and green kind of interior patterns!! Those are eye catching!! ?When it comes to food and drink we ordered one cold coffee! And red valwet drinks with pototoe wedges!! ?Both food and drink are tasty and right quantity for the price we paid!! ?So overall 4/5 ?
5,"My one stop destination for the best coffee in Namma Bengaluru!1. Coffee ToddyCold brew coffee served on the rocks! Loved the flavor of cold brew.2. CappuccinoCreamy milk with coffee served hot. It's just a cappuccino.3. Zucchini PakodaFor the first time I had a Zucchini Pakoda, it was sprinkled with chilli powder and served with sauce. Crisp on the outside and zucchini (coz I couldn't describe) on the inside!"
4,"Are you a hardcore coffee lover and love to try different flavors? Then karma kaapi is the one! Starting from the cutest menu to cozy ambience this place stands out among many small cafes. They have enormous types of coffee with amazing snacks as well. Love tangy cucumber bonda, focaccia paneer Sandwich, fries ,wedges, Chocolate cold coffee here!"
4,A really small cute place to enjoy some nice coffee and chill with friends.The coffees were good . ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a treat to our eyes. The red velvet latte (unique flavour) is actually very sweet and kindof tastes like milk with a red layer on it. But worth a try!The potato wedges and garlic potato tots were nice and crisp too.Really great music and a lovely ambience !
4,"A great place for the yummy parathas. Almost tried all of their paratha offerings, aloopayz n palak weÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâre mentioning worthy.Also had thali here, good phulka but the side dish quality can be slightly improved. Though hot yummy parata guaranteed...."
4,"Mouth drooling Parathas.Too many varieties on the menu which I haven't tried completely, but surely will do some day.Prices are not too much heavy on the pockets as well.The pickle and the Pudina chutney they serve along with the Parathas are delicious.The Lassi is also a must try as well."
1,Very disappointed with the taste and managing of order. Ordered Pani Puri with additional instructions which wasn't taken care . Dahi kachori - kachori not fresh at all and it was very dry and all the masala was dried with no taste.. Same with dahi papdi chat. Guys- u need to improve ur standard !!!
5,"Amazing parathas. I always order online and lassi is one of the best love it but mostly there is no stock of it , it would be great if that could be made available mostly."
1,Need to improve a lot
1,The paneer parathas were minus paneer and tasteless cold... pl don't deliver food just to get money ... try to earn goodwill for future buissnes
3,aloo pyaz paratha didn't taste fresh
5,aloo paratha was great. and the gulaab jamun a perfect way to end a meal.
5,This place has amazing paranthaskitchen is very cleanstaff is very courteousThe lassi and gulab jamun is mouth wateringThis place is a must visit
5,aloo paratha and samosa chat was awesome
5,Rajasthani masala paratha! ???
1,pathetic.. there was cockroach in paratha
3,"Main plus point is hygiene. Taste wise, paratha and chats are tasty. Slightly expensive. No tables. Or even slabs to keep plates. So difficult to eat at times. Slow service and cards not accepted. Quantity is average compared to price."
1,"If you ever come to jaynagar and are hungry, i recommend you to not go to this place because 1. Order takes more than half n hour for individual person.2. No respect for the customer, workers are abusive."
1,Bad very bad and tiwaris. First he refused card payment even when he had POS and the lassi given was less than half of what he advertised. Avoid at all costs.
5,Awesome place with tasty and hygenic food. It is very clean but it is not a proper restaurant. The paratha and dal are very tasty. Parathas are served with soft and creamy curd. They serve parathas with amul butter making it more tastier. Everything is made fresh even the alu curry in the thali.
5,Visited newly opened Tiwaris Outlet at J.P.Nagar 7th Phase located opposite Elita Promenade. Great taste and reminds me of home made Paranthas... Will make it my family's weekly evening eat out from now. Highly recommended for evening eat out.
1,"1.Prathas, don't have stuffing. They are more kind of phulkas than paratha.2. Staff is very arrogant. When bought this to manager's notice. He told, staff is like that. He can't change their behaviour.3.There not enough place to sit.4. Nothing is appealing, except the brand name."
1,Paranthas were too thin to qualify for paranthasMost importantly took my friends here on sunday afternoon.The Staff were not able to keep track of orders and were rude to us.The manager sitting on cash counter was not able to comprehend anything.Not at all good visit . We decided to go to another place to have good time
4,"Very nice quality parathas, and very very tasty. They have nice offers. They have a range of varieties. The chats and gulab jamoon is out of the world. The service is a bit on the slower side."
3.5,decent meal options with phulkas. good option for parathas. the best is the hot khova jamoon. lassi is also good. all in all a good option for a quick meal.
1.5,I had visited the place on weekend it was crowded and I had ordered parata platter the taste was below average and the paratas were so thin you can't call it has paratas they just stuffed chapati.
3,"Any day is good day with North Indian meals for me! Especially Parathas!This place has a range of Parathas, Chaats, Pulka meals, Laasi and Khowa Jamoon.Medicore crowd with decent food.We opted for:- Palak Paneer Paratha, served with Curd, Pickle and Green spicy chutney. It was yum and spicyy.However, I absolutely do not like the idea of adding onions in the Paratha mix so it was just fine as per my preference.- Khowa Jamoon, wasn't willing to try it but on friend's recommendation, I did. It was light and just fine.Service was quick, however, I'm skeptical about hygiene. Could spot some masala in my Khowa Jamoon bowl.Value for money- 3.5/5"
4,Good Parantas... hygienic and value for money.. u wanna grab a quick bite jus drop in..no much space to sit and dine... basically it's a take away point..
3.5,"Very neat and well maintained place. They will make the paratha right in front of you. So its always fresh and not like they just heat the old ones and give you. Since they make it fresh, it will take time. They have buy 1 get 1 Offer on mondays. Other days, I don't think its a value for money. So on Mondays, hey!"
3.5,"Open kitchen, hygienic place. Newly opened with nice offer on Monday. Muddy road right in front of the outlet, not so great for people standing out and having chat."
5,An absolute delight for a North Indian taste bud!Must try their gulaabjaamun and parathas. Thali couldn't taste more homely anywhere else in Bangalore. Mainstream sweet lassi tasted like the recipe belongs to them. Just perfect amount of Sweetness and flavour.
5,"This is my personal favourite place for lunch, especially for those on a budget who have to dine out for lunch on a regular basis. Yes, their parathas are thin but they don't lack on taste. To be honest it's the only decent paratha I've had in Bangalore in the last 4 years. And you have to trust me when I say this. I'm a Marwari, we know our parathas. Moving over to their thaali's, the only negative thing about is that they serve thaali's only for lunch. Price? Yes, they are fairly over priced for the quantity they serve, but they surely don't lack in quality."
4,"Nice place. Positive things hygienic and clean, green chutney,pickle are really good.They should good amount of stuffing in parantha and dont chana dal stuffing in any parantha."
3,"I went there with my friends for having dinner. Tiwari's offers buy1get1 in all the items on Monday. We ordered 1 plate paneer paratha, 2 plates aloo pyaz and 1 plate aloo paratha (each plate having 2 pc parathas) along with lassi. All paratha price are same (80rs/plate).Parathas were not tasty and also small in size. 2pc paratha were not enough for dinner.Staff is polite and humble and ambience is basic one. If they look into taste of the food then this place would be better budget north indian food in Jayanagar 4th block area."
4,Have been to this place several times when I want to have a quick bite. Parathas are very good. Worth for the money. Chats are okay. Service is quick and the place is maintained well.
3,I had been to their outlet in Bsk thought of trying in Jayanagar too. Paratha's are decent. It's thin so the filling is less and you need to eat at least 3 Paratha's to fill your stomach. Their chats are not that great. I didn't like it. Service is not that good nor a friendly staff. Jamoons are very yummy.Not so keen to go again
3.5,"The place is behind the main road of jayanagar 4block RTO, place had a 1.5feet of granite all around to sit, has a huge kitchen, v can't do anything for that ??,they had brand items, ?served with paratha, there was a combo of aloo + paneer + mathi, wch was at ?110, served with curds, chettni, pickel, and don't think that parathas will be soooo thick, they were thin. ......"
2,The service is absolutely pathetic..People here don't seem to be too interested in serving what the customer wants. We asked for Chai along with paratha but we were told very rudely that it will take lot of time. No chats were available also...
3,"The ambience is ok. Service was pretty good. Coming to the food, the paneer paratha was served with pickle, green chatni, a chilli and curd mixed with chaat masala and salt. The two parathas were quite filling and tasty. The dahi kachori was good but with a lil less dahi in it. The sweet lassi was mixed with gulkand which was a perfect ending. The price is totally reasonable."
5,Have been to Malleswaram outlet many times and it's always been a good experience there so tried getting food delivered from this outlet and must say I am impressed once again. Food was hot and fresh .Packing was just perfect . Taste was on point .Had ordered nachos with sauces and spaghetti pasta both were very well done . Delivery was also on time as they had mentioned . Overall a happy customer here !!
5,This is one of the best branches! They have good for consistently. The staff keeps changing so service is kinda bad at times IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâm only saying this cause IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâve been here a couple of times so we knownthe standard of this place! Really nice pizzas and masala garlic bread is divineeee!For more updates follow us on Instagram at justbangaloring
5,The potato crunch burger here in these biggies chains are so good. The service was quick too. Even the deliveries are quicker than expected.
1,"Worst biggies outlet, burger buns were stale, patty not fresh, have tried their other outlets it's good, if anyone tried here for first time they will never go for biggies again, made a mistake visiting this outlet, please visit some other biggies outlet and never this one, even when I asked for bill they didn't gave me that"
4,"you can find this place in the flower market of Gandhi Bazaar and it is one of the best non veg hotel in Gandhi Bazaar, Biryani is one of the best and the status of best"
4,Come here if you wanna eat authentic good savji type food and not for the ambiance! The ambiance is really bad but they make up for that with their food! Try the Raja chicken and you will not be disappointed! There are some dishes you get only in the evening so make sure you go in the evening for dinner so you can have that! Everything That we had was really good! The service is also very prompt and good! You can ask for as many raitas and gravies that you want and they will not judge you ? follow us on Instagram handle Justbangaloring
4,"A budget friendly place with good food.The place is small and always crowded.Thr ambiance I would say is poor but people don't come here for ambiance.Its for the food taste.I had Masala chapathi,Mutton Keema gravy and plain biryani.With the biryani you also get a glass of Rasam.Well overall for the price that you pay the food is great."
5,This place is a must try and if tried once you won't be able to resist yourself from ordering your next cake . Being a Jain Baker you will only get freshly made cakes and the cakes just melts into the mouth like heaven on Earth .Superb taste !!!
5,"Fresh Cakes with customised Designs , baked with Premium Quality Ingredients that are 100% Veg only. Orders with Prior Confirmation only. No Ready Cakes Available."
5,"Best Homemade Cakes in Town. Tasty , Freshly Made against Orders only. They take orders for all kinds of customised cakes. We need to provide all details At least 3-4 days Prior."
3,Was on travel mode and stopped here for breakfast. Ambience is quite ok.Service slow. Idly was hard and sour.Sambhar was average. Dosa tasted good. Taste has to be improved much.Coffee was ok.
4,This has been my most favorite restaurant for punjabi food 15 years back as city was lacking good punjabi food restaurants that time. Though I used to visit their commercial street branch only. First time visited this basavanagudi branch and it reminded me old taste. Still great food.I had rava idly and dava masala dosa.Rava idly is as fantastic as you normally find in Bangalore but rava dosa was awesome. It was spicy so I liked it more.
3,An okay restaurant. Service time sometimes gets too long. Lost its charm now. Babycorn manchurian and falooda are very good. Chats are also good and also dosas but can improve in North Indian gravies

But it wasnt dat crowded n saw few families too... Service was good n friendly... Overall i would give thumbs-up ?"
4,the package was bad
4,Good tasty food.... Price also reasonable... I'm surprised to see such a lower rating for this restaurant..... Thank God I've not seen the rating before visiting the place....
4,Nice biriyani
1,Item was not delivered
1,"They couldn't care less about the service & attitude. Lackluster approach, they don't seem to care! All the negative reviews are justified. Don't ignore these reviews, they are bang on target!! Food is not worth so much of hassle."
4,"I'm glad I didn't see the ratings of this place before I ordered from here cz I probably wouldn't have tried this place. Tried the sholay kababs which were really flavourful and juicy and also very good quantity for the price. The mutton biryani too was good..wouldn't say great, but it was tasty. Packing very good with both the dishes coming in boxes and the raita and side gravy in well packaged covers. Would surely try the place again for more dishes and yes ofcourse, I'm sure sholay kababs are gonna be a constant!!!"
3.5,"Dear Friends,Please don't go by the bad rating. This hotel has been renovated and has got a new management. I visited this hotel for lunch. I ordered a Chicken Biryani & Tandoori Chicken. It's pretty good. But they have increased the prices recently and I think it's way too high considering the food.Quality: 3/5.Quantity:4/5.Price: CostlyAmbience:3.5/5.Taste:3.5/5.The staff is very friendly. The hotel is very underrated. Hope people check out again and rate properly. At the end of the day it's the food that makes the difference."
3,An okayish restaurant nothing special that can be mentioned. The ambience is average the taste is not that great. Pocket friendly place if you have a low budget.
4,Tried online delivery..food was good..must try...chk n sholya kabab is awesome..chicken was soft n juicy in boneless starters..pocket friendly
1,Bad experience. Not worth for the amount paid. The chicken biryani was so bad that we had to just leave it. Pathetic ambience. Quality=Zero!
1.5,Never order food from here!!!I shouldn't be giving even a 1.5!!Every thing about this restaurant is bad.Quality - 0Quantity - 0Staff not friendlyWaiting time is moreIt is said to be Mangalorean cuisine!!!I was surprised to eat chicken sukka there!!! I was wondering what it was...And fish fry tasted like dry spoiled ice fish!!!Don't mess with Mangaloreans... We know how fresh the fish is!!!
2.5,A non veg restaurant. A bit overpriced considering the quality and taste. Good service. Nothing great about food or taste of the food. Decent.
4.5,"This is a small outlet. If you are going with a huge number, you all won't fit in.Food varieties are very good. You should try buthai fry and bangda fry.it's delicious."
3.5,This s a small restaurant but they do have lot of varieties especially in chicken and fish.i like their biriyani very much and price also reasonable.rotti.parotta and fried rice all they have but they are not able to maintaining consistent taste.sometimes it will be good and sometimes will be bad.don't go with high expectations...
4.5,Foods they prepare r really good.. I really love it. Thanku koli mane for such mouth watering non veg dishes... And its also cheap.. So would like to go again :)
1,"Never ever take risk, this place is adjoined to main road full dust and dirty place, I see every day on the way to my place.........................."
1,"Never order in from this place. The delivery boy will try to fool you. i paid 60 rs for two plain rotis. And to top it all i had ordered a single naan. Very displeased. and the rotis were burnt. Pathetic. I would have given zero as rating if possible.I had ordered one chilly chicken , one chicken hyderabai and one single plain naan. i was given  one chilly chicken , one tasteless chicken hyderabai and two plain burnt rotis and was charged 270 rs."
4.5,"Worth it!!U get typical Mangalorean food here.Bhai log, jab budget kaam rahe na toh zarur jao. Space is very less but people wait for hours and enjoy their favourite dishes. Neer dosa with any semi gravy chicken dishes tastes awesome. Especially Chicken sukka with neer dosa is #awesome # mouthWatering. Do visit guys!!"
4,Mouth watering food especially neer dosa ..amazing food at pretty good price
4,"Good place for a quick sandwich in N.R.Colony. It is at a walk-able distance from Netkallappa Circle.Ambience ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ It is a very small shop. You have to stand on the road and it. Take away is a better option at this place.Service ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ The person taking is very courteous. I was here on a weekday evening so the place was empty. The sandwich was served in 10mins.Food ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ I had the Harshi special Sandwich.It had grated carrot, corn and capsicum. It was pretty spicy. They use the regular white bread which is quite small so one sandwich will not be enough."
1,"Poor response from service staffs when asked about available cakes,they don't know English and they are not providing the proper answer just blabbering!!"
1,No proper decorate on cake simple n plan
2,too much cream on the cake
1,the cake was melted the cream was all attached to the box it was not in good condition
4,good cake
1,had order a cake for birthday and the cake was damaged on delivery
5,superb ?
3,Very bad service
5,it's very good
1,"We ordered red velvet cake, they made normal cake to red... worst experience .... Please never visit this shop... They are worst people... They use very cheap cream material..."
2,"Cake yard attracts many people with its name ..This place is located near krishna rao park ...I was here with my family to have a nice pastry .. As we entered lot of pastries are displayed .. variation of flavors, colors and shapes ..and we ordered for creamy chocolate ..This chocolate cake was displayed beautifully and attracted me..but i don't understand the way it tasted for me..pastry was made with chocolate and groundnut .. Groundnut seriously .. i didn't like ..Taste : 2Rate : 3 .. Pocket friendly..Enjoy your foood..sandeepkasal.wordpress.com"
3.5,"This is one good option to buy pastries, birthday cakes, cookies, naans, puffs, etc in this part of Basavanagudi. The bakes are serves fresh. The store is pretty clean & tidy too. On weekends they offer discount on the cookies too. The rates are pretty reasonable & the taste good. Yes, I will be back soon to try some other pastry or puff soon."
3.5,"As my foodie friend Mahima Koteshwar rightly reviewed. We had this cake for one of our friend's birthday. I was little hesitant in the beginning to try a new place for an occasion. It turned out to be great. Black Forest pastry was fresh, yummy and bang on.Would love to be back here for more pastries :)knowfoodknowme.wordpress.com"
3.5,"Just happened to be a friend's birthday and the others picked up a cake from here and I was quite skeptical about this place as it's pretty new and I didn't know if the cake would turn out to be one of like the typical bakery cakes .It was a blackforest cake , it looked very ordinary like a sweet chariot presentation. it so happened that , which also was surprising , the cream was fluffy and the cake tasted good. It wasn't anything extra ordinary but it was good. A simple and a good cake.Since it was an emergency and the cake was bought at the very last minute , I can't complain much . It was fine and I wouldn't mind having these cakes again be it with or without occasion."
3,"Our anyday choice for occasional cakes was Amma's pastries.. Since, we wanted to try something new, we opted to tryout this place.. This place is situated near Krishna Rao park on kanakapura road.. There weren't much options to choose from.. We bought a Honey almond cake and some cookies.. The cake was too dry and average.. Cookies were just ok.. When compared to other similar places which serves pastries, this place is quite pricey.."
3.5,"The taste of the pastries (Gateaux) are good. Not very pricy, But a very bad thing about this place is that they don't accept cards. So better carry cash along with you. or there is an ATM opposite to it but crossing that on a busy weekend evening is also a tough task :D"
3,bought some assorted parties... dint like any.. some how the quality of the pastry is not that great and we can get better ones elsewhere... i do not think i will visit again. This cake shop is very nearby to my house but ts a big let down.
2,"Bad quality of puff, and Bombay salt. oil used for preparing mixture and other items are smelly, may be there are no buyers for it. Cakes samosa and jilebi are average."
2.5,"This bakery has been here since a long time. The taste is quite good. They were having large number of customers, but they lost more than half of their customers since they renovated the place, i dont know the reasons."
3,"The Shop looks good from the outside.The cakes are nothing great,But Pretty cheap.Sponge cakes are too soggy.Almost as if They were Just pulled out from Freezer after a few days, & some water was splashed on them to keep them moist.The Pastries only Appear good.."
4,"Their cakes are affordable and artistic. It is a bakery given a face-lift to pastry shop. The pastries are good, mousse are above average. It is the normal savories, baked biscuits and normal cakes which are still the USP"
4,"Fine cakes with nicely stored, enjoyed black forest and white forest, some times samosa is also nice here.Kurkure items like fried ground nuts and kodubale chakkali fine to enjoy."
3.5,"Cake Art is a Bakery where they serve some beautiful cakes & pastries at affordable prices in the locality. I tried their Black Forest and Butter Scotch pastries and quite decent but not best! They also have bakery products, ones we get at IyengarÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs Bakery. The Shop is well maintained with decent dÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå©cor and hygienic though! During my last visit price of 1kg pastry was around 350 bucks which I feel affordable and value for money.I prefer this outlet for the traditional cream cakes, we hardly see now days. I like those cakes better than pastries! Recommended place for bakery products.bangaloreepicure.com"
1,Ververy bad.....not good always same food dont go here friends....its my advice....previously it was ok...my stomach was upset wen i ate idli here..
3,quantity was less according to the price
4,"Simple and damn tasty food is what describes them best.Potato house is a tiny place with limited seating located near Chikkalsandra post office.I have tried almost everything on their menu. Must haves are Kachi Dabeli, Vada Pav, Sabu Vada, Aloo sandwich.Quick service and nice people too. Do visit them or order via Swiggy."
5,"It's a total combination of good food, hygienic and tasty food, this restaurant is runned by all family members dedicated to serve healthy food with no preservatives added. Food served with a smile always. Recommend friends to visit once."
4,"Clean and Hygienic Eatery from the House Recipe, quickly served with no waiting time. Evening snacks for quick bites with variety of dishes...."
4,"Serves quality snacks with an entire family dedicated to serving Mumbai special snacks like vadapav, finger chip, nurgers, vadapav etc., Except for the time of serving everything else is good. It's a very small outlet with little space for seating but they provide parcel packing and can order in via swiggy too."
3,Delivery by zomato: on timeResponse on call: goodFood quality: average (biryani was poor)Packing: averageQuantity as per price: noOrdered biryani: they sent normal bullet rice biryani even it was not hot.given one egg also.Ordered full biryani paid 130 but did not looked like full biryani.rice was not biryani rice. Biryani was not testy.Apart of this chicken manchurian was good but quality was not as per 130.Guntor chicken was spicy but piece was less.packing was also not good.curry spread over bag.
5,Good place with dinner with family... decent option on Mysore road.. South Indian North Indian and Chinese food's also very tasty..... And Good responsible people....
5,"The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. We especially enjoyed the North Indian foods and Matru Sagar Special Ice cream. Great value for the price. We highly recommend it."
5,"Thanks to Zomato &Matru Sagar ,fast delivery & food tastes good I recommended guys they taken only few min to deliver I really appreciate it thank you soooooo much"
1,"Staff doesn't have any sense at all! They start abusing if you press them for getting something. A place that should never be visited by a family at least. Not possible to give minus rating otherwise ""1"" is also too much for this place."
1,"Though the food is okay in this place the customer experience you get from their staff is miserable to say the least.  To get a simple order they made me wait for 1 hour and when i checked about my order, instead of being apologetic  the stupid manager started throwing attitude and arguing with me with some lame excuses. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. I am for sure never going to visit this place again and will ensure that none of my family and friends visit this place.  This is the second time that I have experienced such a thing from this place. Though the hotel owner is a good person he needs to check the quality of staff members he has. All the best.."
4.5,"Our preferred place for quick food as its closer to our house. Good food and picket friendly,chats are just ok..the service is good and no problem for parking as well."
3.5,"A pretty decent option in this part of the city for a quick breakfast or lunch before you head out elsewhere. We had our breakfast there after a long tiring night journey. Hunger was killing us, thank goodness, the waiter came up with our Puris, vadas and coffees pretty quickly. The first floor is more peaceful and suitable for families who prefer a little more comfort than what is being offered in the ground floor.Overall a pretty nice place for South Indian food in this area."
5,Good food.. Good ambience.. Best in this part of town.. Worth for money and hoping to come back soon once again.. Good place to dinner with family..
3,"Decent option on Mysore Road..ambience, service, food all ok. The masala papas here was yum with coconut shavings on top which adds to taste of onions, tomatoes n coriander leaves."
4,Decent food on mysore road.. South and North Indian meals are decent.Mushroom Manchurian was tasty..Mushroom fried rice and noodles are also tasty
5,perfect mysurpa
4,"Their mysurpa just melts in mouth. They can come out with more variety of sweets.About other sweets, just the same when compared to others like kaju katli"
3,"So everybody likes their mysore pak, what about other sweets? They deserve love too...They claim to be a part of Sri Krishna sweets Chennai group. Almost all of the famous items are available. I tasted badam halwa and it was good (a bit too sweet for my liking). I also tasted their famed kai muruku - tasted good but was not fresh!"
4.5,"After listening to lots of praises of the mysore pak here, We decided to visit once. And on our visit we realized the Praises are truly worthyÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ. Simply Superb, no other wordsÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ!!. Mysore pak is a rich sweet dish prepared in Ghee, from Southern India, usually served as dessert. It originated in Mysore. It is made of generous amounts of ghee, sugar, gram flour, and often cardamom. The texture of this sweet is similar to fudge. ...Read full post on roamingruta.wordpress.com"
4.5,"An epic and unidentified gem of place in the heart of Basavanagudi and synonym for Mysore Pak and Fried Cashews! There are many popular sweet shops for Mysore Pak, still this place is best. The Mysore Pak just melts in your mouth. The old Bangaloreans will definitely sentient about this place. Well, the prices are damn expensive, but praiseworthy. Fried Cashews are something; everyone should try along with sweets. They have very less options the menu without any fancy ones.Mysore Pak over here has got a great texture with loads of ghee and aroma, takes you out of the world.bangaloreepicure.com"
4.5,"Their Mysorepaks are the best i have ever had! even though cost is on the higher side, Mysorepak from here is a must whenever i go to Gandhi Bazar."
5,Wont Say much here as you need to experience the first handMysore pak ( Ghee ghee everywhere ) and Cashew Burfi.. Gimme these two and I am engrossed in this
4,The quality and quantity are on par with cane-o-la. Pocket friendly place for students. Quick service though crowded during college timings.
5,Chilled sugarcane juice in hot bangalore...This is one of the few outlets who provide sugarcane juice.Apt prices... Large glass costs 25.One good thing is they keep the canes in freezer rather than adding ice cubes in juice later...instagram.com
4,It's a blessing in disguise to have sugar cane outlet in ks layout. I must say they opened the juice CENTER in time for general public. Sugar cane outlets are rare to find in ks layout
4,Food - 8/10Service - 8/10Ambience - 8/10Subs here is good same like other places. Sometimes they are out of some breads. Staff here is polite and good in their job. Ambience is well lit and clean with some light music. Overall it was a good experience here.
1,"I have visited this place multiple times it's like just any other Subway. Nothing too great.The reason I'm rating this place 1/5 is because I ordered food from this Subway outlet on Foodpanda. Waited for more than 30 mins and the restaurant did not confirm the order. When I called them they were like they weren't accepting orders from Foodpanda and asked me to speak with Foodpanda customer care. When I spoke with Foodpanda customer care, they told me the restaurant doesn't want to accept the order. Finally my order was cancelled.If they weren't accepting orders from Foodpanda then they should have turned the order accepting device off. The person with whom I spoke with over the phone was very rude and not one bit apologetic."
1.5,This place is a daily mess and best suited for students or bachelors. I will give a big zero to their cleanliness and service. They even charge you for onion. The price on the menu card is not updated which is really unethical. What they serve you when you go and and eat and when you order online is quite different. I was so impressed with their taste I ordered the food online that I decided to visit this place and I was very disappointed with their service.
1,"This is the worst of all restaurant one can ever come across. Once I had asked for a home delivery , literally these people made me wait for two and half hours and then said that they are unable to deliver. The food quality used to be decent earlier but now has degraded . The place is also very unclean and you can always expect rude behaviour from the staff"
3,I have been going to this place for a very long time now. And i have seen this place change overtime. Earlier things were not that good but now i think they might have changed the cooks or something as food tastes better. This place is best to satisfy ur north indian food cravings. Dishes are little pricey for a small place like this!! It is best for takeaways as u won't be able to eat over here because of the mosquitos. To be on the safe side always order regular dishes and stay away from unique dishes as most of them are horrible. If u live somewhere nearby and want to have something north indian u can give this place a try.
3,An average place to eat at if you're having food out on a daily basis. Save money and fill your tummy. Quality and hygiene issue people do not visit.
4.5,I have been to a this place almost a year back and now i am a regular to this place since then . The best to satisfy your North Indian cravings(. Would deffinetely suggest this place.
5,Awesome food service is fast they have changed the taste gave the restaurant awhole new look very yummy food the food was also served at Time within 5 minutes of the order was placed
4.5,"Awesome food...must try veg mumtaz,veg malai,veg hariyali introduced recently in the menu and trust me it's really delicious,well cooked and very nicely presented.Other than the special items chinese cuisines are also good.. litti chokha is also available occasionally and on customer demand which is very homely.. must visit to have North Indian flavours under one roof..."
1,"ordered  for white rice and chicken curry . they took 20 minutes to serve . rice was very cold its like take out of fridge . and chicken curry some kind of disgusting  rotten smell . no one cant eat 1 spoon also . walked out imminently  ,  worst food , worst service .ambiance 1/5food 0/5Final verdict : hospital guaranty  ."
1,"The worst restaurant i have ever visited in kumaraswammy layout. They take a lot of time to serve your order..And then, quiet expensive...."
3.5,The place is small.. not a great place to hang out.. but yeah the food is too good.. specially chicken items.. and the people are friendly.. not even too costly.. overall it's good
2,The worst place to order from here.They will never deliver on time and always say someone else took the order and he has left the shop so please repeat the order.If one wants to starve than can order from here
3.5,"I got my food delivered home from daal roti. Food will take ages to get delivered. Ordered at 10:30 and it got delivered at 12 30. The food was warm, kind of tasty. I ordered chicken kassa and 4 roti combo, egg curry and 4 rotti combo."
3,I will say a nice place with tasty Chinese flavour; Non-veg isn't halal so was not able to taste but the veg served was goodPrice is bit high based on the quantity and ambienceOverall a good food served
3.5,I would so a ok kind of place to give it a try.Food tastes yummy.The only problem which i feel to be concerned is hygiene.As i found this place can be maintained properly in a tidy manner.Service is good.Must Try - Noodles and other Chinese items.
3,"I eat here often and I always go for the rice thali. The food here is good in terms of quality and quantity. Spacious seating and quick serving of the food is an added advantage. College students are a regular crowd there. I would recommend this place for the working people, who come after a long tiring day and don't want to cook yet want quality and quantity food. Price is pocket friendly and food is worth the price."
2,"I have been a regular customer for over a year. Started with just one room now they have large space, definitely doing good business. Vegetarian food are good. Non-vegetarian food are average. The only bad thing about this place is customer service. When I tried to give feedback about the food they were not ready listen. Home delivery is worst. I stay nearly 100 meters away from this restaurant. Every time I have to explain where I stay. It was frustrating."
5,This is like home for me. Always love going here late nite. Love d kulfi the falooda & brownie sizzler... Even d sundae r equally good u should try every variety every time u visit . Lots to explore.
4,"A review after being here number of times. Amazing lassies infact, n looks like iv tried almost everything in their menu except for their faloodas cs I don like them anywhere. Chocolate sizzler is a must try n love the fruit salad with ice cream(simple n nice)...Love to this place always."
4,This place is always buzzing with people and is associated with a lot of fond memories. This is one the little gems of Jayanagar. Their falooda is one of the best in Bangalore. Falooda kulfi is my favourite. Royal falooda comes a close second. The lassi is another must try item. Its the best place to beat the heat. Frequenting them on a Sunday afternoon has become a regular affair.
4,So this is like place we go after belting high on hari super sandwich as this place right opposite to it. Love their hot chocolate fudge sizzler.Always refreshing to come back to this place for some desserts. If you are around do visit.
4,"A very busy and crowded place in jayanagar. Had been here to try out some drinks.They have many options in their menu. Juice, shake, smoothie, falooda etc.Ordered Lichi Shake. It was really delicious. Perfect chilled and sweetness. Usually in other places shakes will be full of ice and too much sweet. But this shake was perfect. Loved it!Definitely gonna try out other options as well."
4,My alltym fav place...They serve Desi style of icreams n faloooddaaaaaaa's.....Been here a million times....Falooodaas and fruit salad with ice creams are the best and yymmmmyyy !!!!
4,"Located right opposite to Hari Super Sandwich, after gulping down all my favorites from there, I had to quench my thirst.Most of the time I order for Watermelon, without sugar and without ice, that's when you can truly taste the fruit for itself. Usually I get disappointed, but not here.The juice was so FRESH and GOOD, I felt healthy after drinking that. HahaAnd the best part is, it's at a very affordable price."
5,Delicious mouthwatering. Would be great if you provide us with more pastry options:)
4,There werenÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât enough sugar packs for bulk coffee order.
1,Very bad! Pathetic exp
3.5,"Lovely place and locality to hangout with friends and family. Had been with friends, late night, and tried out Tropical iceberg. Was so good, for a late night order."
3,leaked food
2,it was nice and fast delivery
3,"The staff here are a little rude. You are not allowed to complain to them . They need to start serving food faster. The coffee is splendid, but you will have to wait for a very long time for your coffee"
3.5,"Cafe Coffee DayA place to end up for typical Coffee culture in the locality since years. CCD has made a very good name in Taste and Quality. They have their own standards in delivering the product. There are several outlets in the area, this is 8th block one, located opp to Vasudev Adigas Restaurant.They had International Burger Festival ? going on, but I just headed to try cup of hot coffee.Ordered Vanilla Cafe Latte which was milk based. They hardly took 15 min to serve. Had ordered for King sized.Vanilla Cafe Latte is something refreshing with vanilla cream and flavour on it.Good and plesent place to sit back and relax for the cup of coffee. Outlet was clean and welcoming.Food - 4/5Hospitality - 4/5Cleanliness - 3.5/5Service - 4/5Value for money - 3.5/5"
3.5,"As it says, a lot can happen over a coffee,& it was raining outside so I order for hot king cappuccino, & my frd order for green Apple tea, tawa pizza, it was good ?"
4,"Wow, I'm the first one to review this specific Cafe Coffee Day! I wonder why there are no reviews yet, since this happens to be one of the better CCD branches.Me and an old friend usually meet up here first, before we go elsewhere, to have a couple of beverages. This CCD has been out point for contact for a year now, and it was him who introduced me to it. It has good outer seating, and the umbrellas above the tables provide a nice little touch.The menu is the same as other CCDs, so I won't really go into too much detail. Strawberry Pom Smoothie, Cool Blue, Crunchy Frappe and Classic Lemonade are my favourites. As always, it's slightly overpriced. The service is pretty good, though.Consider dropping in here, if you're around the area.Food - 3.5/5Ambiance - 4.5/5Service - 4/5Value for money - 3.5/5Hygiene - 4/5Overall - 4/5"
4,Stopped by during our travel. This place serves the best sambar. No matter which dish i order i make sure i order their sambar with it. All time favorite.
4,"Location is right on target and this restaurant caters to fast eaters. The major chunk of people opt for self service, which is faster. Try the dosas which come with a range of accompaniments. Good spread, but the North Indian and Chinese items might take a wee bit longer."
4,We stopped her for a good breakfast so that our journey can be resumed and my god what delicacy they served us. Our stomachs were so happy after having meal here and I would love to stop here in future as well..??
5,Sri Krishna bhavan is the best hotel in Bangalore which is situated in banashankari.The taste of the food is very niceAnd the ambiance is very goodLove this place
4,"Have been here multiple times. For one, the place is close to my home in Bangalore. Two, because of the variety of food they offer not to mention the taste and quantity.It's a veggie place. Some good options to choose from particularly in main course. If you are in the padmanabhanagar area, this restaurant is a must visit.My verdictAmbience: 3/5Taste:3.5/5Value for money:3.5/5"
4,Place was kinda ok.. ambience wise.. food was also fine.. we had ordered butter chicken.. don't exactly taste like it.. but was palatable.. kinda reasonable too
4,Food - 4/5.Price - High.Best place to party. Price of liquor is cheap compared to food.Yes must visitBest place to visit for dinner with some drinks.
5,"We are literally hungry, just went inside to have a lunch , we got a menu so we placed order for chicken biryani and south India meals? food is very delicious ? service is very good and staff are very friendly ? we enjoyed our meal and coming to ambience nothing much to say about it.. one more resto for bucket list ?"
4,"Good Food & Prompt service . To improve the Ambience .   We had Chicken Biriyani ,  Silver Fish Fry & Egg masala .  Not very expensive .  Home delivery to be extended to Commercial street & around that place ."
4,"I am in love of the food this restaurant brings to the table. The first thing that comes to my mind is ""WoW"". I ordered Bangada Masala fry which was cooked so tenderly. Then the chicken sukka reminded me of my native. This food will show you flashbacks if you are a mangalorean. Everything is connected very well.Food: 4.5/5.Service: 3.5/5 (Food is fresh so it takes time to. prepare)Quality: 4/5.Quantity: 4.5/5Quality & Quantity to Price, Ratio : 4/5All in all this place is epic. A must visit if you have a craving for seafood."
4,My friend refer me this hotel. We tried neer dosa n egg curry.. That EGG curry was just amazing... I never tasted egg dish in this flavour.. must try for egg lovers4star because dosa was not hot
1,We ordered boiled rice but they send plane rice......
4,excellent coastal food
5,Superb food
4,"Timely delivery and authentic Mangalore style food.Ordered bangda fry and egg curry, both were hot and delicious. Will try more dishes soon."
3,chatni wasn't there...chatni should be given with neer dosa...
5,awesome taste and content also high ....I love it
1,the worst food packing.
5,Very nice food.. Authentic Mangalore taste
2,"food is good , but the they have given white rice in place boiled rice"
4,liked the food.. fish was yummy!
5,"I would give this place 500 stars if I could. The food is just so damn tasty that I can't even think of a word that would do justice to it's awesomeness.One suggestion, go for Sea Food only, the Mangalorean cuisine is famous for that, not chicken.I order Prawn Ghee Roast with Neer Dosa and an Anjal (Fish) Rawa Tawa as a side.You can also go for Bangda, that is also a very tasty fish.Stuff like Neer Dosa (3 per potion), Boiled Rice and White Rice come with 'Meen Saar' (Fish Curry) which is very very good.It is a must visit place!"
5,"Must try - chicken ghee roast, Kundapura chicken with neer dosa, egg bhurji, prawns, squid Sukka.For all sea food lovers. Value for money.Tried almost all items. This is my first preference for sea food delicacies. And I would like to recommend to everyoneThe owner is also friendly and they deliver to places within 5 km."
4.5,This is a small restaurant which full fills your non veg feast wit their great karavali style ..every dish here is tasteful..chicken ghee roast and anjal Tawa fry is must try here ..overall the perfect joint for sea food and karavali dishes ..
4,"Must try Briyani here. There is something different the way they prepare Briyani, it's not a typical Briyani but taste very good. I used to visit this place at least twice a week when I was in college. Do give it a try. Not a fancy place. Just try this place for taste."
5,"Frequent visitor, Best place to have sea food. Must try anjal rava tava fry, Chicken kabab, bangada tava fry. Pricing is very reasonable to the quality."
3.5,"In the hands of an able cook, fish can become an inexhaustible source of perpetual delight and delight it truly was at this humble, no-frills eatery that serves in coastal mangalorean cuisine! A hearty fish meal that included Bangda(Indian Mackerel) fry, Anjal (Seer Fish) fry, Mathi (Sardine) fry, Neer Dosa and Gassi, Biryani and butter milk to wash them down. My top picks are the Anjal and Bangda along with the biriyani! I'm not a sardines person but my friend absolutely enjoyed it! At 300 bucks per person this is absolute value for money! Thanks Vinayak J Prabhu for taking me to this wonderful place!! I'm gonna come back for more!!"
4.5,My favourite go to place when I want to eat sea food in a simple ambience and dont want to pay a lot of money to enjoy the food.  The fish thali is decently priced but I love the prawn sukka.  Must try
4.5,This hotel is run by natives of kundapura. Good coastal food. Especially fishes. All items are cooked in proper kundapur style! Reasonable price.
4.5,Good choice for the coastal people. The food is good. worth for the value. Specially for coastal & fish eating people. Even you can order from home & its free home delivery.
4,Happened to visit this place after having breakfast elsewhere on a Saturday morning. It's your basic coffee/tea stall. A bit on the pricy side when compared to your normal Darshinis but the the coffee and lemon tea we had were good. Quick service.
4,"Ambience - 3/5    Food - 4/5  Service - 4/5  VFM - 4/5  Parking - NoHatti Kaapi is a chain of coffee kiosks at various locations in Bangalore. We visited the Jayanagar branch one Sunday morning, after a hearty breakfast of idli at a nearby place.We ordered the regular filter coffee and a Mysuru coffee. The filter coffee was strong and made just right, and managed to satisfy my wife who has pretty high standards for it. I too loved the Mysuru coffee and would surely recommend the same.They also serve light snacks to go with the coffee, which we left for another visit."
4,"Here you can find different types of coffee and snacks, the place is quite nice, best place for evening hangouts in Jayanagar, this is in front of Jayanagar 3rd block police station"
5,"Easy on the pocket, and Best Filter Kaapi IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâve had in Bangalore. Badam Milk was good too.They also offer other items on their menu including Samosas and Banana Cakes. Nice place to hang out during breaks."
4,"Hatti Kaapi is a chain restaurant that serves a variety of South Indian snacks and coffee. This outlet is a very small one located at Brigade road. The location is excellent and the snacks are tasty. I have visited this place twice and had their Mini Idli, Regular Idli Sambhar, Hazelnut Cold Coffee, and Filter Coffee.Their Mini Idli is very good and so is the Hazelnut coffee. It's a self service outlet and their is no place to sit so you will have to stand."
3,Food - 3.0/5Ambience - 2.0/5Service - 3.0/5Can Try - Filter coffeeClue - Coffee was good. Bisi Bele Baath was tasting good and served hot but needs improvement in quality and freshness.
5,"Good place, nice taste and finally stomach filling items with reasonable price and the staff are friendly and helpful, customization available. If your choice is rolls them you just definitely go to this place."
4,"Pocket friendly, good quantity and taste. No question of 'ambience' and 'service' here... Its more of a take-away or delivery kind of place... Mostly meant for students..."
3,"Love their egg paneer rolls. Place is too small. Totally a budget place. Don't expect too much. Not too clean. Might as well stand outside and eat. But rolls being their forte, they're amazing. Recommended."
4,I am a vegeterainans hence few choices to eat..!! Tried all veggie choices..!! Such kinda places are very worthy picket friendly..!! And tasty too..!! Worth trying...!!!sakhiravoor.wordpress.com
3.5,A pretty in the budget place. I ordered a veg and a chicken roll. They were good in quantity as well as taste though I liked the chicken one more.
4,"Rolls are sort of your regular diet if you are a college student. They are cheap, quick meals .This joint let's you check in both boxes. And additionally the taste is also good. The rolls aren't too oily nor is there any overbearing taste of any sauce.We bought an egg chicken roll and a gobi roll(Sagar Kathrisal is pure veg).The egg coating on the roll was really fluffy and did not even a bit have the raw egg smell. And the chicken was really juicy.Also, please not this is not exactly a family ""restaurant"". It's more of a stop, take and go kind of a place.As long as the food is tasty and easy on the pocket, I am always happy."
4,The place is meant for all sorts of eaters except families. The quantity that you receive for the price is good and eve the taste is fine. Mid you find the place too claustrophobic then just get it packed or get them to deliver at your place. What's best is you have them in food panda with good deals. Well with the price they offer I really doubt if you need additional deals. Try their egg chicken roll. You'll not regret it.
4,"Scrumptious!!Had been here for dinner. Their ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâBharjari OotaÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ menu looked inviting. So all of us chose to try ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâBharjari OotaÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ. It was a right call. Everything they served, was so delicious. It is a must try for hungry souls. I loved their Masala Dosa which was a part of the oota. Perfect foods! You also get to end this lovely meal with an ice cream.Next time your around this place, donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât miss out."

Quality, service and ambiance is simply awesome... over all good place for unlimited lunch for reasonable price...."
4,Lovely place in the side road. Yummy idly and dosas.Road side parking. Hygiene is well maintained. Pricing is quite ok. Poori Sagu was nice too.Perfect place for peaceful outing.

1,Cold and tasteless. Had to throw most of it.
1,My worst experience of the whole chain of Anda ka Funda Restaurants. Both Sattu and Aloo paratha were really bad. Something which is not expected from this brand name.
2,food was not upto mark...rolls were filled with cucumber and salad

4,gud
1,very bad food waste of money i ll really uninstall this app poor very poor quality foodfrom next time on words i ll go with swiggy thank u
1,worst chicken roll i had ever the roti was so hard to swallow.
1,"WORST FOOD, price is Rs.80 but quantity is not fill for one person also , taste also too worst, this is my bad experience in ZOMATO, half quantity of rice still remains shortage of curry , I lost my money, please don't encourage this type of hotels ,"
5,I'm so happy with your service.
1,Bad restaurant. Got spoiled food item and a item was missing as well.
3,Everything was good except Ghee rice doesn't have a flavour though!
1,"So this place can be described best as "" Mood Spoiler Funda "". Very unprofessional people with food which tastes extremely bad and the packing is even worse, who packs food in polythene bags. No balance of seasonings are there in their food. I receive wrong order as well.Quantity is extremely less, it's one portion food only. I would never ever suggest anybody to order from this restaurant."
1,wrong delivery I got
1,"worst service, ordered veg but delivered nonveg food"
2,"While the noodle was good but the Biryani was not even close to real biryani, rice with few dry spices and chicken pieces!"
1,"Worst service , they wont pick the call even that store number does not work only , without delivering food . they will tell food is delivered. Worst worst service"
1,I not received food
1,worrrest food
4,the egg rice and inlet was superb and trust worthy but packing style should be changed
2,the quality was not good.
1,"Chess egg roll was not tasty, it was just onion and chess nothing else was there in it . Tastless."
1,food was not tat good
5,taste good
1,Hairs inside the food.. And even a fly.. ???pathetic
2,Average
5,food
3,The rolls that they give are good but one would preferably opt to take away and home delivery as the place is slightly on a unhygienic side. It'd be good if the people sitting on the counter and kitchen are paid more attention to hygiene factor.
3,packing was at all good.
3,"food was okay , though the packing was not good."
3,Good restaurant. For Chinese itemsIt's near water tank jayanagar 4 block. beside lassi point. Very little space. Only 4-6 can sit. So it's specially for online delivery or pickup.
2.5,"This is one place I'd think twice before going.Located in the prime area of 4th block, it's a small fast food joint. Food here is not that great, but for the price they offer, it's okay. I've heard the chicken dishes aren't that great.The veg noodles are decent."
4.5,Excellent place for your taste buds! If you are fed up of eating south Indian food!! Best place to experience freshly cooked north Indian food!!
4,Sattu paratha was really good here. The place is good for a quick hot meal. Don't expect to find a cozy space. Find you seat and grab the parathas.
4.5,"Good Food. Value for money, specially in southern part of India where North Indian food is costly. If u are in 4th Block Jayanagar, just drop in once, and try Parathas. They are worth trying."
4,"I usually dont go to this joint but theyre all the same with the same menu and taste.......Love the food here,for the price......!!!!love the parathas and the biriyani......all chicken sides are boneless and taste good.......Food-4/5Price-5/5"
4,According to me the best chats you will get near Gandhi bazzar is vinayaka chats. I have tried almost everything but Pani puri was best. Even dahi puri was yummy.
5,"Not gonna lie, the place is quite crowded and busy, which will get on your nerves. But it's worth it for their tasty chats. I had here a week back n have gone back since then, coz the taste is that good. Their masala puri is really yummy, so is their gobi. One of the best places to have chats."
3,"Good place for chaat items and juice. We tried their masal puri, Bhel puri, pain puri and lime soda. All good, except panic puri. The puris weren't crisp. Us too heavy on the onions. The Bhel puri portion is quite generous :) seems to be a popular place to hand out during evenings. No seating though."
3,"Service - 3/5Taste - 3/5Parking - 3.5/5I have tasted chats, Juice and sandwich here, where chats like dahi puri and masala puri are good and others are not so impressive. Whereas juice i feel that it is not thick as it should be and it doesn't taste good. Sandwich is just average. The only problem here is the queue that we have to wait for our turn for the chats. Not a place to visit in weekends."
3,"There was small cafe when i was young in this place, Later when the Park opposite to this was remodelled they started this CHats and Juice centerIt started attracting all the local people around Nagasandra,K R Road, N R COlony,Gandhi Bazaar and was a huge hitWe can go for a quick bite of the actual chatsThe menu was regular initially, All kind of chats, Masala,Pani Puri,Sev and Aloo Poori and Juice centerLater they started Veg Sandwich, SamosasComing to the taste, Masala is not as tasty nowadays compared to before, Bhel Puri is good among everythingI have tasted thr sandwich as well, It was very dry and sauce/ketchup was not thick and not tastyComing to the juice section, they serve the best Mosambi juice in Bangalore, I have never tasted a better one than this.sridhar1206.blogspot.com"
1,Worst taste and worst service. Please don't visit this place. For chats one has to wait like beggar even after paying money.They don't know how to behave with customers.
2.5,Not a big fan of their chaats which always has a weird after taste. They also have fresh fruit juice which is okay. Food not really unique. One of those many fruit chaat centers.
4,Ibaco has some amazing range of flavours of icecream.We had icecream cravings after dinner and this place had option to takeaway after 11pm.The ambience of place is really good with the pastel colors used in the decor.We have options to choose the toppings as well on the icecream and the payment is based on the weight of the same.Must try if you are in Bangalore.
4,Located perfectly opp Sapna book house in Jayanagar.This place serves Delicious Gujarati as well as north Insian snaacks.Top Picks#Khandvi#Khaman#Vadapav#Dabeli
4,"Best place in Bangalore for Khandvi and Jalebi!! Always fresh and tasty, very hygienic shop. White dhokla is also too good but thats only for customized orders, not available at the shop! Everything is Yumm here"
1,I had called them for Enquiry the lady on phone was very rude..... first her words were not clear so i called again and the answer she gave was rude no doubt they didn't have the thing I had asked for...but in service industry there is a word called POLITENESS....which I m sure that lady didn't have...
3,Samosa was not hot
3,"Good taste. I ordered to my office for snacks time. Samosa was cold,Kachori was old I suppose, otherwise good taste and quantity. Perfect spice. Visiting the store is recommended. At store, on Sunday morning I ordered Khandvi, fafda jalebi and kachori, all was served hot."
4,"Jalram makes one of the best jelabi in town.Sunday mornings are the best time to visit for some freshly cooked jelabi.Love the dokhla , fafda as well.They do have good pav but comes in pack of 20s.Visit early for the pumpkin chutney with fafda. Gets over quite early in day.Parking is a challenge."
3.5,"Fairly popular place for sets and snacks. Owned by a Gujarati family. They have the usual stuff like samosas and kachoris but they also carry fafda, jalebi and Dabeli as well.I had samosa and rasmalai. Both were good. Would love to try khandvi and Dabeli some day."

3.5,"Known for its Gujarati sweets and savoury items. Best for its jelbi phafda and papaya chutney. They also have dhokla, khakra, bhakarwadi and many Gujarati items. On sundays it opens around 7 am and serves hot jelbi. You have to some time wait a long of time. The jelbi is thin and crispy. It is also famous for its panipuri poories."

5,"Good ambiance to sit with chats and sandwiches,Chinese surrounded by your fellow friendsI liked the fast service in which you get good taste."
2,"Great mood was spoiled by cold,soggy and stale samosa.We, specially north indians can for once take insult if done to us but when done to samosa,never.It is my humble request to the outlet that either you deliver fresh samosa which must be hot and crispy or please remove it from your menu.Coming to masala finger chips. They seemed good to me and were worth the price paid."
5,"A complete 5 for the yummy chats and sandwiches! Usually crowded every evening, staff manage the incredibly with their quick service! Right from chats theirs literally every thing you'd want to much on - pav bhaji, sandwiches, ice cream rolls!"
4,Pocket friendly place for chats and sandwiches.Green chillie cheese sandwich is a must try(better than the expensive once from polar bear).Dahi poor is really good. Pav bhajji not so consistent sometimes too salty Nd momos good not great.But yea worthy enough. Vll surely try ice creams Nd shakes ... After winter?.Panduranga Amberker
4.5,"You'll love the chocolate sandwich and the corn as well. It's delicious. The only thing is before they never used to put potatoes but now there sandwiches are made with potato stuffing, otherwise chats are really delicious. Corn sandwich is a must try."
4,A cute outlet near the Bda complex. With a variety of cake models just you need. They are specialised in customised cakes. Tisll now I have ordered 3 specially designed cakes. And they gave it in what way I wanted. You get a number of options in their catalogue to select. The mini macron's are tasty. So just visit there and get your customised cake done for any occasion
2,"The cakes here are plain and drab. Ate the macaroons there. They were tiny and werenÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât even macaroons. The taste was bad. The cakes were ok, nothing great about them. Not worth the price."
2.5,"A very tiny kiosk with a promising menu. The desserts taste really bad. We had a red velvet pastry, which was dry and flaky. The panacottas used to be good, now itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs just a gelatinous slop of mess. The owners arenÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât very-friendly either. Very slow service."
4.5,"Its a tiny kiosk located below McD ,opp to bsk bda complex. Menu has varieties of cake options, comes out with customized cakes also.Cakes are available from 150rs. Cakes are absolutely delicious, spongy, fresh, n yummy.Cup cakes are aso available.Pocket friendly. Red velvet cake is my favorite ???Guys check out this place if u are looking for tiny cute cakes n customized cakes."
3.5,"Very tiny places, but the cakes tasty very good! They should have more options of eggless cake.Recommendations are fruit cake, butterscotch and red velvet."
3,"Nothing more special..The meals is money worth it,nice ambience.small budget.service is really good.must try their tiffin.i felt happy.maybe come back"
4,"This place is one of my favourites and has never disappointed me with quality or quantity of food!! It's surprising how the food tastes the same even as years pass by.. the menu has limited varieties and everything served on their menu tastes best! Personally my favourites have been mudde with two kinds of curry, red and green, chicken kabab (so crispy and good), mutton Keema balls and mutton chops.. the quality of the mutton is to die for!"
4,"This is the best place in Kumarswamy layout for Breakfast and Snacks. Ground floor is normally crowded, but we prefer first floor A/C section. Would rate 5 out of 5 just for Coffee. It's too good. We come to this place from Katriguppe just for Coffee"
5,"Ideal place for me to have my Sunday breakfast and snacks .... Good South Indian food and had a good variety of South, English and North foods."
2,Went here for breakfast n had masala dosa. It costed 42/-which is quite high compared to other hotels. Nevertheless I got the dosa just like how I had asked them to make. It was crispy n made with less or no oil. Happy with that. However it was not complimented well with chutney or sambar. Preferred to have the dosa just with the masala. Then had coffee n it was given to my liking. Strong n sugarless. Overall a decent one just above average fare. Nothing great or out of the world.
4,"Easy on the pockets. Menu is a bit different with kodabu, mysore masala dosa and few more items from kodagu region. Hygenic and at well versed location"
5,"From the dark Caves, candle lit tables, spicy Afghani cuisine, perfectly cooked Briyani with quality spices , basmati rice and cool curd raitha to complement it makes your taste buds to fill with joy!"
3,"Yes, the food was good! Had Afghani ghost biryani, chaat and chicken tikka. It was good. The ambience is something to look out for... A cave on the fifth floor, waiters wearing safari suits, covers of the menu in tiger prints... A lot to take in. Worth your time"
4,"Love how this place is been running for soo long . The ambience, the staff, the interiors n food has remained the same . Really tasty food . Love the biryani, rasamalai n roti curry . The starters are rich in taste ."
4,The restaurant had a unique theme of a cave and the ambience was really great. Had been here with my family couple of days back. The food was pretty good the mushroom pepper fry was amazing with perfect blend of spices for the fresh and tender mushrooms. Chicken tandoori was nothing great just like any other restaurant. The chana stuffed paratha was unique and nice . The afgani biriyani was mind blowing it's a must try and the paneer gravy also was good. Overall this would definitely give you a different and great dining experience.
4,"The theme and ambience were quite spectacular! And the food just added the cherry on top of the cake. Apollo fish is a really good dish, do try it!"
4,"Had been here on a Saturday night !! A cozy cave ambiance with candlelight to jazz up the weekend mood . Courteous staff and delicious food . Ordered pahadi kebab , afghani dum subzi biryani, laccha panner jaali , Murgh jalferzi everything was so delicious medium spiced. Quality and quantity wise was good . Worth the penny spent . Had Alice in president mocktail which thou tased just like strawberry shake . But overall a nice experience."
3,Theme based restaurant. Highly priced. Dishes are just okay not that great. May be a good place for non vegetarians. As its in the center of Jayanagar easy to locate.
4,"Best one loved ambiance which has wow factor. Perfect theme resturant , as name suggest .Its was unique experience .Coming to food, Chicken starter was best, Afghani dum biryani was good.I think service should be little improve other then that everythink was perfect ."
5,Love the place for its ambience and creativity ! As the name sounds itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs literally eating inside a civilized cave! Food is awesome ! Really recommend! Love those qubani ka meeta!
5,The ambience is super amazing and one of a kind! Provides a feel of cave life experience. Just loved it. Food is a bit expensive there compared to other places but was great in terms of both quantity and quality. The service was good and the people there were courteous enough.
4,"The ambience of this restaurant is their USP.Of course, the food is delicious as well, the menu comprises of North Indian cuisine.But, it's the ambience and decor which is ""Oh so appealing and a feast for your eyes."" It definitely resonates with the same of the restaurant, and makes you feel that you're sitting inside a Gufha (cave) and enjoying a scrumptious meal. A unique experience indeed."
3,"The ambiance of this place is very nice but when it comes to the food it did not meet our expectations. Ordered one Panir starter, felt like Panir was not fresh. Also the misi roti which we ordered in the main course was not at all satisfactory. People over there were humble though along with prompt service.."
3,A cave themed restaurant with waiters dressed as huntsman serving you with not so great but not too bad either food. Whatever you do don't order their potato starter. I never knew that you can mess up a potato dish. The waiter's recommendations were not so great. Don't experiment here cause they kinda experiment a lot I guess. Go for the ambience and just order the usuals
4,This place was on my list from so long n finally I made to come here. I liked most their ambience which by name 'Gufha' itself gives the feel as u are entering into a cave. The paneer tikka was amazing I suggest people to must try it. I would further see to visit this place again
5,"Bold and beautiful. Full marks on ambience, food and service. The kebabs were a delight, but I gotta say I've never had a better rumali roti in my life! Simple is the best. Thanks Gufha and keep it up :)"
5,This s quite diff place to visit. This almost looks lik a scary house. The ambience are not lik usual restaurant itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs totally diff.The staff dress s very diff and they are politely and friendly.Food s just amazing. And the sitting is too good and u have privacy place for each table.A one should just visit.
2,"Very average food but ambience is too good. The theme of the restaurant is cave based. We ordered Butta kalimirch (4*) which was good but other food items were very average such as Ruzwali kabab (3*), Achari paneer (3*), Afghani sabzi (3*). The vegetabke sheekh kabab was the worst (1*) as one of the stuffed vegetables was stale."
5,A cave like theme restaurant. Peaceful and perfect ambience. The staff is super amazing with good service. They are cooperative and the food tasted really good.
4,"Me and my wife had our first candle light dinner today. Had cream of tomato, baby-corn til starter, achari panneer thikka, rumali roti, hot chocolate fudge. Service and Ambience were awesome. Thumbs up!"
3,Gufha is located inside the president hotel. This place has a cave like interiors. The interiors of the place is just marvellous. Sitting arrangement is quite good. The staff of this place is Soo cooperative. The food is quite good too.You may find a service bit slow.I found the place over priced. Taste of the food and presentation can be improved much.
1,Horrible horrible food. Don't get deceived by the photos of food they put. Ordered veg fried rice with Paneer Manchurian combos got spoiled 2 pieces of paneer coupled with low quality rice with horrible taste.
5,Very speedy service. Taste is good. Complimentary foods and drinks. Neat packing and served hot. Shared with our friends and quite filled our empty stomachs.
5,Amazing food with great taste along with best service and affordable price. Best hangout place with friends after college hours.#Tanna Kitchen
1,"Worst place I've been to. Not hygienic, hospitality was very bad,. The chicken was completely old and soggy . I recommend everyone not to come to this place"
3,Have ordered food from here on multiple occasions and found the taste of both their south and North Indian dishes as OK. Decent place for vegetarian meal.
5,"The delivery was on time even during rush hours.The pizzas and garlic breads were pretty warm and nicely packed.Cheese garlic bread- The breads were fully loaded with cheese and soft. Were very scrumptious.Garlic Breadsticks + cheesy dip- The breads were perfectly warm and not very oily. Tasted heavenly with the cheese dip which they give for free.Chicken full smash- We went for double cheese blast for this one. The toppings on this one were even more than their tagline which says x2, Go for this one. HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDDouble Cheese Margarita- It had lots of cheese and the Margherita being my friend's favourite, this pizza was loved by him. I honestly didn't like this one much, can skip if not a margarita fan."

I feel to be such victim after trying mojo pizza going on zomato rating google maps rating is 2.7 and zomato rating is 4.0 how can there be so different gap in rating... Didn't expect even a pizza could taste so bad, made a wrong choice of trying new... The deliver person was so stupid in finding the address and upon that a bad pizza... The price they charge is no less than other international brands... Mojo Pizza shame on you cheating people a big F*** U from me...."

Fresh toppings and a fluffy base with right amount of cheese, just a perfect combination.Price wise its a bit on higher side compare to others. Otherwise everything else is excellent."
3,"The mojo pizza serves the hot, spicy, cheesy pizza's. The have the best crust and amazing options to choose from. The 10"" pizza's are filling. This delivery outlet only disappoints in the packaging and the garlic bread. We have ordered twice from here and the second time was fine. The first time the pizza's were moved and crumbled. I would request the people to take care of the packaging and delivery a little. Coming to the garlic bread, it was over baked and burnt at few places.Rest all is great with MOJO! GO MOJO!!"
3,"Tasty pizza, the base is good and as the name suggested there was an overload of veggies. It's a very heavy pizza and it's tastes good.It's one of the most decent tasting pizzas I've had which are made for a fast food chain unlike an authentic wood fire pizza.Note, It's only to order and use *APP199* on your first order on any pizza. You can thank me later."

5,"This Mojo pizza outlet that's opened recently is going to become just go to pizza place. I'm a huge fan of Dominos pizza for their quick service and resonable prices. Mojo pizza is doing just that but serving better pizzas. I ordered a Paneer tikka cheese blast pizza, American bbw chicken wings and Indian tandoori chicken wings. The order got delivered in about 35 mins. The food was hot, yummy and just want I wanted.The taste was very good and there was so much cheese. The added advantage is that they deliver till 1 am. I'd definitely recommend this place."
5,"Mojo pizza has taken away my heart completely. I'm so in love with the brand. When I think of good pizza this is the only brand that I can rely on no matter which state I am in.Recently on my tour, we did some Netflix and pizza. This time we called for:Pepperoni and cheese: If you're bored of chicken, try this. The flavour and essence is so damn drooling.Chicken full smassh: So much of toppings. The sight itself makes me hungry. Two of us had three pizzas that day!Half and half pizza: Love it when we can try two different flavours in one pizza itself. Choose your favourite, we went for the basics here.Their delivery and packaging as usual was amazing. Came in hot and fresh. Recommended :)"

5,"I cant believe I missed this Pizza delivery place! All this while I've been ordering from Big International chains!The crust was amazing, the toppings were loaded to the edges and so its quite evident that we loved all the 3 pizzas we ordered and the Garlic bread was better than the big brands. The free sauce that came with the bread was not all that great, but when the pizza is great...I did not mind it. we used home made mayo dipping sauce instead!The Thin crust cheese blast was a bit a like ""biscuit"" but the Pan tossed was perfectWill be ordering again soon as the offers are pretty attractive and the choice of doing half/half toppings is added bonus."

Swing seatings around and nice set/walls to click pics.Located in basavanagudi near APS college.Food: 1) Almond cake- is nicely mashed on the coldstone with almond cake and ice cream and served on the wafers basket. Was good.2) Chocolate butter- this is a must try which was very buttery along with chocochips. This is made on the coldstone in -40degrees and is served as icecream rolls.3)jelly belly- this ice cream was completely filled by gems,jelly's and chocochips with caramel sauce. It was okay okay.4) Nutty fudge- same as almond cake ice cream which is made on coldstone with different ice cream flavour filled with different kind of nutties.5) fruits sundae- overloaded with 5 types of fruits with chocochips and chocolate sauce.Service: was good."
5,I reached this place after continuous requests from my nephew to satiate his ice cream craving.he ordered a chococup and i ordered dark chocolate belgian scoop. The taste seemed perfect. It was too yum.the staff was hospitable too. totally recommended.
5,"My friend had all praises for this ice-cream palour, he insisted that we be there, so one fine day i got a chance to try out some ice-creams here, they had a hugh variants of ice-creams, we settled down for chocolate ice-cream and butter scotch, it was awesome, I infact ordered the second time too"
5,"Icecreams, Icecreams and Icecreams.I simply love the Ice creams here, they have a wide variety of flavours and they are awesome, we had been here with friends and enjoyed eating Icecreams."
5,During my banglore visit I tried icecream here . Super yummy ice cream one must try Dry fruit and choclate choco chip and vanilla flavoured ice cream here
3,"Newly opened place with a very thoughtful ambiance and a lot of options. The prices are a bit high but acceptable in this area. The option we chose was a terrible one with too much artficial flavor and gummies, gems and magic-pop (too much esp for kids).I am stll hopeful that other flavors will be good (will update the review after another visit) and rate this place 3.5 considering the good staff and wide variety at offer"
4,"Small but good place, what is different well they have swing instead of normal chairs which makes it more fun. Well taste 7/10, ambiance 8/10, service 10/10, value for money 7.8/10. Try dark chocolate. They mush have belgian chocolate. Customised options make is more interesting."

However crowded it gets your food will not be delayed.Food ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ Menu is similar to Brahmin Coffee Bar but there are you additions like Avalakki (Flattened Rice) and Navane(Millet) bath.I have tried their Idly Vade, Kharabath and Avalakki. Every dish is served with chutney, you donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât get Sambar here.All the dishes here are really good but Idly Vada is a must have!"
4,"Yet another old-school, old Bangalore type breakfast joint in Basavangudi. Obviously didnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât disappoint.Tried the usual:Khara Bhath, Idli Vada, Kesari & Coffee."
4,"4.5/5: This place may not have the legendary status yet, as it is relatively new, but is surely going to give the other hotels in Basavanagudi a run for their money. The crowd swarming around the food court makes you wanna dive right in and eat the food. I've been there twice, and am stumped by their crispy dosas and yummy chutney, and their filter coffee. Filter coffee is not a rarity in Bangalore but there are some places where it should not be missed. This is one of them. Another important thing is their importance to hygiene even in the extreme rush. I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit and try their infamous Kharabath and semiya upma."
5,This is among the best breakfast places around basavanagudi. The chutney is simply perfect in terms of spice and consistency and goes very well with idli and vada. Kesari bath is also very good. They keep the place hygienic and service is systematic and fast. Dishes have value for money and are very satisfying. Will keep visiting frequently.
5,"I just love this place. Their hot idli chutney and vada, avalakki is something to drool about and the thought can make me hungry at any point of day. Best part is their filter coffee after a scrumptious breakfast. That completes it all."
1,STAY AWAY. Dingy dim lit entrance. Like a corridor in some dark ghetto life movie. Walk up and your greeted by staff lazing in a dark corner oblivious to your presence. You don't need any specially honed sixth sense to tell you this place spells doom. Isn't there a way to give negative ratings here.. Like some Golden Raspberry Award or something. This review doesn't even deserve more words than this. Bah!
4,"We ordered American sweet corn soup in the jayanagar branch, it was really good , it was served hot! Right amount of vegetables were also present."
5,"Today been here for dinner with my family, we ordered veg corn soup, chicken wings and chicken fried rice? soup was so yummy ?Chicken wings are super tasty ?Chicken fried rice ? was excellentService is goodAmbience is decentOverall we enjoyed the food this my 3 visit to this place? good food , good place and good service too?"
2,"Very slow in service and they give preference for service section and parcel only...self service is ignored, waited for almost 1 hour and we still waited, lack of staff and nobody to care for us"
1,"Worst food. Takes some level of genius to mess up simple dishes like bhel puri and masala puri. The paneer manchurian was pathetic, could only taste tomato.Bland and tasteless, ingredients were stale giving a bad taste. Don't waste your money here."
3,the quantity was awesome but quality was not good and packing was too small due which food came in lumps
1,no spoons very bad
2,i ordered North indian food.. taste and quality was below average and they took 1 hr 15 mints to make it . i was starving when food came i was not hungry anyone.. bad delivery and bad food.
3,"I mentioned do not use dalda, but they applied. otherwise its good"
1,One of the best example for how not to manage demand supply! They take so much order and a simple food item you need to wait for 30-40 mins by when your stomach may melt off. Food quality is ordinary and you may visit only when there is no other option on earth.
3,The Hotel is A very old Food seller in the locality of Uttarahalli.This hotel has been newly reconstructed with a impressive look.The food available here is just like any other normal hotel and the taste is Just above average.Both A/C and non A/C halls are available.Just above the hotel is Party hall that can be rented for function purposes.Food you must not forget to try here is Roti and Dal that is available post evening.
4,"It's a nice eat out when you walk with NO expectations. Clean home made feel of food and service. Staff are simple friendly and helpful too. For sure there is variety in the food served... like dosa dessert favoured rice vada kosambri etc. You can view the wide spread in the pictures shared. There is obsolutely no commercial aspect attached, be it in the ambience or the food served or in presentation. Offcourse the entire serving is healthy cause all the variety is made of millets and only millets.A one liner would be....Millet mama is mama's food made of millets :)"
4,"We got a catering ordered for school kids from this place. I got to taste millet laddu, millet bisi bele bath, millet halwa and everything made of healthy millets!! Authentic south Indian food made from healthy millets. I would recommend this place for anyone put up in and around South end circle.The place is a zero budget investment. Its decorated with flowers baskets and fruit packing wood. The walls are decorated with warli painting and the ambience feels HOMELY!!!!"
5,Superb...loved d taste very much??...pani puri s ? white pani... No wrds to talk bout d taste...choc sandwich s also one of my fav...evryone has to taste it..
5,"This place is just my favorite. I love the pani Puri and masala Puri. It can't get any better. The other thing was that when I didn't have the exact change the cashier just let me go, that was truly kind. ?"
5,"Located in Jayanagar 7th Block, Prem's Graama Bhojanam is a new and refreshing place to have good healthy and delicious food.We had items like Thatte Idly, Millet Paddy, Jolada Roti, Navane Rawa Dosa, Benne Masala Dosa, Coconut Jaggery Dosa, Shunti Kashaya and Majjigae! All the dishes are served with delicious sambhar, peanut chutney and tomato chutney! The water served is RO Water ( with Tulsi, Camphor, Clove, Cardamom)Definitely a worth and must visit place! One of the most heartening things was that the waiter was from Orissa and in just a short span of 5 months of coming to Bangalore, he had learnt how to speak Kannada! When I told him I wanted a glass of Buttermilk, he said ok sir, ondhu majjigae ?"
5,"What a brilliant find! If you are in the vicinity and need a wholesome, goodness filled vegetarian meal, do drop in here.Went here for lunch today and place is a homely, neat space. It was so cute to see a kolam on the dining table and the water, they serve has notes of cardamom and cloves and is so unique and refreshing.We ordered the executive millet thali and literally every item was lipsmacking, my faves were the crunchy masala vadai, millet pulao, veggies and especially the Kesari/sheera. YummyThe thali is pretty filling and rest assured you will exit with a happy stuffed face! They serve their tiffin items post 4pm.Service was super friendlyTotally recommended for a supremely VFM experience!Decor-7.5Food-10Service-9Overall-9"
4,"Have been here a few times for lunch and dinner.They are a millet based restaurant, very good for health conscious peopleThey have dosas, rotis and rice varieties in all of which they use millets only.The taste is good, esp the dosas. Millet biriyani is good tooAlso they give water infused with spices, itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs very refreshingLove the jaggery matka kulfi, it is so light and tasty without sugar or any artificial flavoringAmbience: 3.5/5Food: 4/5Service: 3.5/5Pricing: 4.5/5Must try: Dosas and jaggery kulfi"
4,"No Sugar, No Maida and No white rice. Everything is made out of Millet. Food is tasty, tried their Millet Thali. Loved the curd rice and sweet made out of jaggery and Millet(extremely tasty). Service was really slow, we sat there for 15-20 mins and no one attended the table."
3,nice place .... hardly any people ... tasty delicious food but the quantity is very very less ... they need to work on quantity n pricing then would definetly recommend it to others ...
3,"Prem's graama bhojanam, a village theme. Visited this place several times, penning a review today. Tulsi water served for drinking is the highlight. Paddu outer layer was nice crispy but inside was too hard and just a tasteless dough, was disappointed ordering it. My personal favourite here is pesarattu only if they serve it crispy. The next favourite is raggi mudhae with the vegetable or sprout sambar that they serve..... really yummy and filling too. Millet rawa onion dosa is yummy again only if served crispy. Found cost to be too expensive for a dinner, rs450 for two for tiffen variety. The noon lunch with millet variety rice and South Indian dishes are very filling and different but wouldn't call it yummy. Variety rice in millets needs improvement. Dessert with black rice is yummy while wheat flour just okies. Overall it is mediocre experience but calls for multiple visit cause of the traditional millet based food."
4,"A vegetarian restaurant specialised in millet based dishes. All items are made with millet only, but it will be one of the tastiest meals ever. Amazing tasting , full of flavours , nice decor and vibe. Friendly service and huge portions.We tried few items in the menu, all tasted great . Loved their sambar rice n idly. Desert was good too.i canÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât wait to come back to try the other items in the menu."
4,"Lovely homestyle millet based meals and snacks. Loved the masala Vadas and the thali that came with a millet roti, delicious saaru, radish subzi, tomato millets, Sambar and Rasam millets. The sweet Pongal was so good!"
5,"Lovely, Excellent, Superb, Healthy!!! I had couple of visits. So had many dishes during our visits and all are very good in taste. Someone has written in review that healthy means tasteless. Well, This is not true here. Its just everyone's taste has been developed different way and some people are adaptive to all kind of good taste like me ;).Service is very good, prompt and welcoming in all experiences.Rating is for food service ambience hygiene altogether."
5,"Easy to locate, exactly opposite to Bangalore International Academy. Nice little outlet with a village-based ambiance.?Serving only a range of healthy and yummy millet-based dishes. If you're here, have the Thalis, they're filling and filled with Variety. We ordered the Chapati Oota, Mudde Oota and the Executive Millet Thalis.... And damn they were good!Chapatis were soft and fresh, Rassam rice and Bele Bath were made with millets and were good. The dosas with the executive thali were well prepared, wouldn't know the difference between a regular dosa unless told?In the end I was full, and content with the quantity served in these Thalis, the buttermilk too was very refreshing on a hot day like today....I sign off on a very positive note and would love to try their snack items as well ?"
4,"we head to this restaurant for dinner on Sunday night on advise of a friend .This place have a rustic ambiance which can appeal to you or make your mood off depends on the situation. But ambiance  is symbolic to rural patterns  .we tried Benne Masal Dosa, Ragi Masal Dosa, Jwar roti , Sambhar rice , Ghee Roast Dosa. Every thing has a great taste . Specially chtanai they serve is very good and tasty. In desert we tried Moong Dal payasam.Food was excellent in taste. This place is known for the ingredients they use in their food. They use millets and samaik rice in place of regular sugar and white rice. They serve camphor treated water which is referencing .Ambiance - 4/5Food Taste- 5/5Food Quality -4/5Presentation - 3/5Service -4/5"
4,Definetely a must visit place if u want to eat healthy yet tasty food.The masala red rice dosa with sweet potato paliya was awesome.V enjoyed all the dishes thoroughly
3,This place we visited as we had to wait for a friend and we had no other place where we could hang out. The ambience is not great and since smoking is allowed its not advisable for kids and ppl who don't want to be a passive smoker. Food is ok but coffee was good .
4,"This is small cute place near Ramkrishna hospital. Ambience is really the best. Do agree there are smokers all around but if you want to sit n have a long chat with friends or a loved one, than this is the place for sure. The charges are reasonable too. This one's surely is in my books.."
1,"This place is for smokers alone. The pizza is greasy and all sorts of unhealthy (as pizza usually is) but quite alright. The beverages could be so much better. What the place lacks is good staff. There are impolite and lack basic courtesy/decency. One particular waiter forced us to buy food, while we were just happy with our coffee. The ambiance could be so much better if there was a separate smoking zone. Utterly bad experience."
3,There was a time where this place used to be my adda. This place serves the best hot chocolate. Food used to be delicious and now it's average. Very slow service.
2,"They have really bad options for food. They have consistently bad service. This place is heaven for smoker's. If you're a non-smoker, then Java City is decent to sit and chill for a bit if you can find a place in a corner that's away from the smokers.Also, this place is a little hard to find. Don't make the effort."
4,"If you're craving for North Karnataka vegetarian meals then this is that place. Two floors are assigned to serve the meals and the other two floors serves south Indian snacks and breakfast munches. Getting a table here will generally takes time due to the rush in peak hours. However, there's some live carnatic music here to enjoy while waiting for your table. The meals is served in a banana leaf which makes it more homely and interesting. This costs around ?250 inclusive of taxes which makes it very competitive and pocket friendly. The overall taste and quality of the food was above average. However, the service here sometimes gets really slow and I really feel that the restaurant should work on improving this."
3,"The special North Karnataka meals here is one of the good spreads that you can get. It consists of a chilly bhajji, holige, jowar roti, brinjal curry, lentil curry, green leafy sabji, raita, rice rasam sambar n curd. The overall ambience of the place is alright and the service is ok. The speed of service is average. Can come to this place once in a while to savour the north Karnataka food. There are other joints of course"
4,"We have been for dinner , food is really tasty we just loved , this place is good for pure vegetarian ppl ,toilet is not clean at all ,they need to maintain the cleaness .Overall Experience was good"
3,If you want to taste north karnataka food then kamat bugle rock is the best place for diningQuite good ambiance with music around the placeBest for family
1,Very Disappointing.... Terrible food...Ambience is ok.Taste is Pathetic. On a Saturday morning except our group of 8..no others... why such poor quality and taste..heard its going to shed down too...Ppl opt better place.
3,"Happen to visit in confusion over a weekend on my father's birthday. Mix veg,palak and tomato soup was next to awesome NEVER try to order Punjabi starters because it is just to increase the menu items and in reality dishes are in. Veg kolapuri and mushroom masala was ok for the breads and ghee rice to close the orders was just perfect. Jowar roti meals is all time hit over here to try."
3,"It has lost its Charisma compared to my past visit.The taste of the food has gone down.This place is easy to locate, no problem with the parking.Food is good. Ordered Special Roti oota. Felt it should have been little more spicy. Ambience is good enough.The only 3 rating is because of the service, very poor, we had to call each and every time we wanted to get served.You need to visit in the weekend, if u ever want to listen to some soothing live music. Also it's better to get your table reserved as it will be crowded in the weekend."
3,"Another popular eatery in the Basavanagudi area.The star dish of the place, obviously, is the one that it's named after, the humble puLiyogare.After having heard about this place a lot, my expectations were set very high accordingly. I have to say that the puLiyogare fell short of matching the expectations. That isn't to say that it was bad, it just was good but not great."
4,"As the name says, I tried puliyogare here. For ?40 quantity seems to be less but taste wise it was really satisfying. I feel the authentic Iyengar style puliyogare, it was Pretty good place with good food."
3,"We just tried the puliyogare here. It was good. However, having tasted puliyogare at a number of places now, we didn't find it any different. But then what more can one expect from humble tangy spicy sweet rice:-) just tat I won't take a cab to go to this place just to taste the rice. Divesh Thaploo"
4,"Don't judge a book by its cover and a restaurant by its appearance! Puliyogare Point is one of those tiny eateries with some delicious food.The highlight of the place is their fantastic Puliyogare or Tamarind Rice, that tastes exactly like how it would in an Iyengar home. The Sakkare Pongal is another delicious dish, their version is second to none. If you're here, also try their Akki Rotti, Mini Idli Sambar, Ambode, Kanchipuram Idli and Ragi Dosa.Some would say the quantity is quite less for the price, but considering the quality of the food, it's totally worth it. Do try if you're in and around Basavangudi."
4,"One of the good places to eat around Basavanagudi area. I tried a bunch of items during a couple of visits to this place and loved the taste of Puliyogare, Vangi bath, and the sweet Pongal the most! They serve good filter coffee as well!"
4,"Its been at off street to DGV road Gandhi Bazaar. Had experienced pickup and service both. Both are good. The signature dish, Puliyogare rice is really excellent. I have never experienced such taste in my last 15 years experience of same dish. Excellence with Perfection!!! no single ingredient overrules other ingredients. Great. Though their Vada is one piece 20 rs price which seems expensive for this kind of joint. But taste is really good. only 1 point less because of the price point. Ratings are for food and price."
4,It is a great place to try variety of rice dishes. A very small place with more take away and less seating. Sweet pongal is probably the best in the city. I like puliyogare and khichdi too. This has become one of the favorite places in my office for ordering lunch.
4,"The food at puliyogare point appears simple, but the flavours are at remarkable depthWith friendly staff'sAnd coming to the menuI have tried puliyogare and Coconut riceBut coffee was not that much good"
2,"Ambiance - The shop is divided into two, one self-service and the other is the service area.Service - It wasn't crowded in the morning that we had been here. There was a single guy managing the service. He would deliver what was asked for and disappear.Price -  Food was moderately priced whereas the coffee was priced higher than the other darshini.Taste - We tried the following items.Puliyogare - I had a lot of hopes on this dish as it's name is part of their brand. I was expecting it to be mind-blowing but it turned out to be regular puliyogare that you can easily get elsewhere.Coffee - Inspite of asking to serve it strong, it was below average.Medu dosa / khali dosa - This was the best item we got to taste. They were filling, soft and crispy. They were served with chutney (average) and sweet sambar (very good)"
5,"Had lunch here.40 rupees for puliyogare. The quantity is less I feel for 40 rupees but it was enough for me.There are other items like mini meals,Curd rice etc available.The place is divided into two places.One is self service where you stand and eat and the other is with seating chairs with service.Both the departments are beside each other but separated by a wall.The food taste was good and different."
3,Had been here for lunch.Ambience is ok.Service is too slow.Staff is ok.Prices are high.Street parking.Dint like food.Just average. Took lemon coriander soup crispy corn aloo anaar. Roti was very hard.Gravy ok.Cooker biriyani was ok.
4,"This place is located really close to where I stay and it's definitely my go to place for light snacks in the evening! The jalebis here are amazing! Must try :)The Raj Kachori and Tawa Pulao ate good too. Would love to visit again, thanks ?"
4,"A busy restaurant with many options to choose from that includes innovative dosas and sandwiches. They have both self service and service sections.We tried three dosa varieties - cheese, Schezwan and Pav bhaji. I would recommend cheese from these 3. The dosas are very crisp and served with delicious sweet sambar and chutney.Also tried the classic Pav bhaji which was very yummy!The pricing is good with attractive combos making all this tasty food affordable also."
1,"Had been for dinner last night to this place as my friend was craving for some Andra Chicken Curry.The ambiance is decent for a fine dine.For starters we asked the staff to suggest something in tandoor. He suggested us Murgh Banjara Chicken. For main course we ordered Rustic Andra Chicken Curry with plain rice.The starter was very bad. It has only garlic flavour on the outer n bland inside. Have never had such pathetic tandoor.Well we were hoping that atleast the curry would be good, but the curry had no flavour apart from chilly. It was just spicy and bad.Very disappointing experience.And the prices are too high for such bad quality food.Not recommend."
4,Visited this place for lunch. Its a hidden gem in jayanagar. Ambience was good and service was fast. Pot briyani is must try item. Food was tasty.
3,"This is a small family restaurant located in jaynagar which serves North Indian cuisine food..I got to know about this place through zomato gold went for there Dinner with my friend.The staff was really polite and the service was really quick.Coming to the food,I ordered Bamboo biryani which was good but not as good as expected (it tasted more like a pulao)Butter naan and butter chicken was yummyAlso don't forget to order dragon prawns here,it's the best thing I had here(had all the spices right and was cooked really well).If you're in and around jaynagar,do give this place a try?"
4,"Food 3.5/5Ambience 4/5Very polite behavior and very hospitable.Bamboo Biryani was nice but not spicy, so ask them to make it spicy as per requirement.Sizzler was nice.Creamy cheese pasta was the best amongst what we bought."
2,Had a horrible experience here.Came here and ordered food. The staff just got the naan and roti and didn't get the main course.Turns out he forgot to write it. I mean how can you just forget to write the main course and just get the breads.By the time the curry was prepared he took the naan to reheat it and burnt all of them.We ordered Bhindi masala for main course and honey chilli potato for starter. Before you order those be careful as they are pretty spicy.The starter was good but the main course was not that great.Wouldn't recommend this place at all.Staff-2/10(very careless)Food-6/10Ambience-7/10
4,"Ordered here for the first time. Though quantity was a bit less, taste was good. Lot of raw spices added. Pepsi was also part of the delivery which was a surprise. Please try to make the chicken soft which could have got this rating to 5 stars."
4,Nice small cosy place for hangout. Not much to offer as we went there at odd time. Still they prepared everything fresh from scratch. Staff is courteous and ambience good for a small place.
3,Main attraction here is the biriyani which they serve in mud pots and bamboo containers. Though I am not sure if they actually cook in it. A decent place with cool interiors.
4,This place has a very modern take over some indian dishes like pineapple rasam which is delicious! They are famous for their bamboo biryani !!
3,Good little place!We visited this place on Sunday night for dinnerThis place is very small and as around 6 to 8 tables . The ambiance is good .We order for guntur chicken and the famous bamboo biriyani and it was delicious but the bamboo biriyani taste was not to the expectations!Overall a decent place to have food.
2,"Pathetic food... we were fully upset after visiting the restaurant and we were fooled. We had ordered three sauce pasta. They did not know how to make three sauce pasta. We visited this in the beginning and we were not happy. We just paid the bill and came back. Did not even go for second time and did not recommend for friends. Hope now they would have found better chef and improved their quality of food.Ambiance is good, price was good but only food was disappointing. I give two star rating just because of the courteous staff and the hygiene practices followed."
2,"NA SE KOREAN RICE FROM RUSTIC STOVE!A quaint place in Jayanagar, often overlooked by passerbys but offers a wide variety of dishes - especially for the non-vegetarian in you.Decided to go for the Na Se Korean Chicken Rice as this was a dish I'd never seen on any other menu.Honest review: Nothing great about it, tasted like just another ordinary mixed fried rice with a different masala. But it had an assortment of veggies in it including broccoli, babycorn, potatoes, etc. The chicken pieces were comparatively less.They also need to work on their hygiene standards. Not bad for a one-time visit i'd say.Item: Na Se Korean Chicken ricePlace : Rustic stove, Jayanagar @rusticstovePrice : ?249 + GSTRating : 3.2/5.....#theakraanthub #foodiesofinstagram #bangaloredays #biryaniclub #koreancuisine #foodphotography #foodstagram #footfetishnation #foodporn #bangalorebiryaniclub #eatinbangalore #trellingfood"
2,"Was enroute to some seminar I would say. Just stumbled upon this place on the way. Like the rest of the reviewers meant, looks like the place is a house converted to a small cafe. Found only one manager/cashier/waiter, well probably cause it was a weekday.Ordered just 3 dishes and 2 beverages. Well did not like either one of them, except for the beverages. Potato cheese balls was soo bland in taste and they gave mayo dip with it which makes it more bland. cheesy pasta was cheesy alright but filled with onions, more like onion pasta,errr. Blacky chicken wings, well sounds rascist though, was cooked all fine but still lacked the taste.On the brighter side, place/ambience was way better. The only staff, was courteous!Food - 1.5Service. - 3.0Cost effective - 3.0Ambience - 3.5"
4,"This place has the right amount of everything. Good food, homely ambience, friendly staff and worths the price. Do not miss the bamboo chicken dum biryani. Simply love it."
5,I really loved this place sooo much ?I'm going to give 5 for this! The bamboo biriyani and the sholay chicken was sooo good? the place is not that big but that's okay !Food was very well served
5,"Probably the most unplanned late lunch ever xD Rustic Stove was one hell of an experience. We went at around 4 in the evening, so the tandoor was down. We ordered a few starters following by main course : Chilli pepper mushroom, babycorn chilli, Capsicum stuffed with paneer and gravy, Chicken starter, Dal khichdi, Bamboo veg biriyani, Schezwan noodles and Creamy cheese pasta.Each and every item was so filling and tasty. We loved the food as well as the cozy ambience of the place. The staff was very courteous and the waiter recommended the items himself. It was a great experience :') Will definitely visit again."
4,Food taste is good... but it can be definitely better... furnishing can be better as it is little congested while sitting... good value for money... definitely recommend this place if u looking for a casual dining
1,Ordered on zomato delivery for curiosity... Food was good but the quantity was as good as nothing... The 2 portions fo bhel puri received was not even the half you normally get from other places... Half of the silver container was pressed from bottom to appear the contents to be full... Pav bhaji was received with 3/4 of the plastic container without chopped onions and lemon.... Waste of money...
4,"This newly opened place is really not like any other Udupi Upahar/Sagar. They have a wide variety of items from south Indian, north Indian and Chinese cuisines. They have chaats, juices, ice creams and sweets too. This is an all-in-one place for a quick meal. Ambience is good and there is self-service. The taste is slightly more on the south Indian side, but nevertheless, the place is great."
3,"The newly opened one at a prime location offers south Indian and north Indian cuisines.. I had ordered paneer tikka masala on a rainy day, so cheers to the service .. I received the order on time. The food dint taste great but not bad to be tried too , a good one flavoursome gravy.."
5,I did visit to this restaurant today with my family. Guess what it was awesome! Taste was awesome. Ambience is super. Self-service based restaurant. I prefer to visit this restaurant again and again as it is very near to my home.
3,A small place to hangout with your friend while eating the regular food. The ambiance is perfect and the place is a must visit for a good afternoon lunch.
3,This place has been my favourite ordering spot for a while now.....since it offers a good range of desi khaana to select from at reasonable rates...the afghani chicken here is one of ts kind...sweet and spicy .....so not many wud like it...but ts worth a shot for a different taste....the butter chicken and chicken manjurian are my mains here....as the flavour is on point....So try this place if you are in an occassional mood for hogging up some anti-diet full grease desi meal.....
4,rice bath was good but the potato palya in masala dosa was not good it seemed like old leftover palya
4,Chatni was very less
3,Good and reasonable food and pricing. Masala dosa and coffee tastes best. Ive been regular there since my school days. You can expect north indian thali and chinese manchurian too.
1.5,Very high price for the bland food they prepare. Potato palya in masala dosa was spoilt. Gobi manchuri and fried rice are too bland. Staff here behave like they have never seen a girl.
3.5,"This place is on my ""go to"" list when I'm hungry and at this part of town.I've had breakfast here quite a few times , apart from the North Indian style food that they serve.In my opinion, the breakfast here isn't as good. I've had poor experiences with the masala dosa (c'mon, who can mess this up) where the dosa was not completely cooked the first time and then when I told them about it the next time and asked them to roast the dosa, they burnt the dosa.I have enjoyed their soups, paneer chilly and North Indian dishes like roti, Kaju masala, paneer butter masala, etc.I would go here only for their North Indian and not for their South Indian dishes"
3.5,Decent south and north Indian dishes. Taste and quality is good. Bustling with people of all gen. Been my favorite for so many years. Best try Masala dosa and awesome coffee.
4,"Being a regular visitor to this part of the town, I have had breakfast and evening snacks here many many times. Perfect place for a quick bite without pinching your pocket. Although a self-service place, there a a few tables and the place is quite big. The best part is their quick service. . Idlis, dosas and the other usual suspects are all yummy but do not miss their pav bhaji and masala puri in the evenings."
2.5,One of the most overrated place. Food is just the normal compared to rest of the hotels. Quantity is less than the others. Nothing special about it.
3.5,"This used to be our after college hang out place, loads of memories here.Food is served fast and relatively good taste. Love the chats there"
3.5,"Good dosas in early mornings. Nice and simple idlis.. Nice curries.. Taste 3.5/5 . cost 5/5, service 5/5, hygiene 3.5/5.. They need to step up on their hygiene"
4,"When i was broke during my college days and needed some food , matru sagar was always to the rescue with very economically priced items ! Their paper masala dosa can fill and entire clan of hungry people with its quantity !Must go for people around banashankari :)"
4,"I've been a regular there for 8 straight years, 2006 - 2014. I guess, I've at least spent a lakh or so there. It's the place that's practically introduced me to Kannadiga food. The quality has always been very good, and the mini meals are a treat.This place was a hallmark of my college life, as I lived in the neighbourhood. Can't believe that I'm reviewing it here, after all these years..Saar, ille na parcel?"
3.5,"I don't know how many times I've visited this place. I stayed in one of the adjacent cross roads, so one can imagine. Their south and north Indian both are good and tasty. Though i like the rotis subzis much :D"
2.5,"Usual South Indian restaurant, nothing exceptional about the place. A place you may go only if u stay nearby and don want to travel at all to eat !!!"
1,Bit carefully..sometimes they serve embedded cockroaches in idlies..it happened to us twice. Some times there will b cockroaches under the table wher we eat and climbs table to join for breakfast with you..
2,This is a self service restaurant. Badly maintained. Taste Can't be compared with UD or Adigas. Chats are terrible.
3.5,"This is one of the darshinis in the area that serves decent north Indian food. Pocket friendly, decent taste. They have Good menu - south Indian, north Indian and indo - chinese"
2.5,Ok
5,Good food . North Indian dishes are good. Fast food joint even has place to sit and eat.
4.5,I visit often when I don't feel like having food at home... Food is always good... Especially Idly Sambar and masala dosa... Try gobi manchuri and baby corn manchuri... It will be too crowded... Quality is too good and they maintain the standards... Best restaurant in Hanumanthanagar locality... Only disadvantage is that they don't have service...bangaloreepicure.com
5,"Pretty good.. have been eating here for the past 7years are so, the taste never changed.."
3.5,"The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Matru Sagar is their mouth watering Paneer Butter Masala and of course the crowd. I didn't know Matru Sagar has branches until recently but apparently they do. There is one on Mysore Road too close to Bapuji Nagar junction. I have only been to this location though.I guess I might have put on 5extra delicious pounds just by eating Matru Sagar's paneer butter masala. I used to frequent this joint during its busy lunch hours and their time management during those busy hours is much better than any other regular hrs. One would expect to wait longer during rush hrs and to be served quicker during non-rush hours. But, for some reason it works the other way around in here. May be something to do with the manpower I guess.Anyways, the point is Matru Sagar serves delicious food every single time and has a lot of returning customers. So stop by next time you are in the area and do not forget to try their Paneer butter masala."
1,The food was wonderful until I got a coin very recently in onion dosa...wouldn't even mind to give a negative rating if there was an option
4.5,"The best fast food restaurant more than 10 yrs delighting its customers:)They serve all south indian dishes..idlis,dosas,bonda soup,kesari,kharabath, carrot halwa,kaashi halwa,bondas,bhajjisYou get a range of sandwiches,pav bhaji,milkshakes,ice creams,Manchurians,fried rice too and a host of chat itemsYou have south,north indian meals as wellU have seating too now.. Do visit this restaurant and taste lingers on..."
1,lack of quantity and quality too
4,nice food
4,The delicious South Indian breakfasts. The wheat pongal is worth a try. Udupi style kotte kadubu is soft and filling. Overall thumbs up for a taste and quality by keeping it simple.
2,rice bath is not good
5,super taste and sufficient food
1,food not delivered
1,actual item was not delivered and not worth of money
1,No chutney nor sambar given
3,Nice
1,I have ordered uppittu it was 28rs .. I have got only 3 spoons in small container. who will serve in such a small tiny box...they should mention in menu properly ...I was shocked when I saw small box tiny box that exactly looks like cheese dip box from dominos this should be taken care by zomoto. other than that all other dish was okay....
1,didn't got order to rate
3,Quantity is very less
5,fast delivery?? delivery boy is very fast
5,Best place to fill your tummy?
5,very good exact timings
4,super
4,"Happened to go here with a friend of mine who had come from the US. Her and I have been meaning to visit this place from 2013 but it never happened till now.Ordered the prawn ghee roast, krab masala, kori roti, chicken gravy and appam. The food was yummy and cooked to perfection.I had ordered a beer and it wasn't cold enough. Service was pretty quick and I enjoyed the whole experience."
4,A fine place to dine with your family. It's a treat for sea food lovers. Great service. Drinks are genuinely priced.There is a separate area for smokers. Most importantly ample space for car parking :)
5,"This is quiet a new place near Dayananda Sagar college. This place serves some amazing Chinese dishes, the quantity and quality of food is apt for the price paid. Though the place is quiet small so dining in might be a little conjusted but you can always get your order delivered to your place. Triple schezwan fried rice is one of my hot favorite at this place."
2,"Looks so good, but the taste? Not even work the money, kababs not properly fried, the biryani has no aroma, short and simple: not at all recommended"
4,"A cute little cafe located in Basavanagudi finding it was tuff. The food was tasty we tried their Jalapeno popper's, Alfredo pasta and Schezwan rice. The quantity was little less for the price but overall good experience."
3,I have been curious about this place since it has pita on the menu. We ordered in from Aira today. Looking at all reviews here I decided it was best to try pizza pocket. As promised it was hot and cheesy. It is tasty but it could be better in terms of vegetables used and how cooked they are. As for the falafel roll - it is a fail - the sauce used just doesn't go with it. All Lebanese rolls come with dips as the bread is too dry. You guys should really relook at the way you are pairing food.
4,"Eaisly identifiable in vv puram road,basavanagudi.This place gives a homely experience with friendly staff. The place is very clean with fine arts on the wall. Though the place isn't huge,but is peaceful.Food: 1)ordered classic nachos which was really great at taste with salsa mayo.2)pizza pocket was quite interesting where the ingredient are stuffed inside which was really hot and good.3)veg cheese pasta was really creamy and tasty.4) mojito, though the quantity was less but it was refreshing.Service: self service to be done.Ambience: small and cute cozy place with fine art on the walls with cute little benches."
3,"My order-1. Falafel sandwich-Pita break stuffed with hummus, falafel and few veggies. IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâd rate it 6/10.2.

4,A small cafe with amazing pastas and fries!!Had the pizza pocket which was soo cheesy and good.Overall had an amazing experience here and the cashier was extremely friendly too ^_^Food:3.5/4Ambience:4/5Price: 3.5/4
3,"I had been to this place with one of my friends, it's a very small place but decent. And nice place to hangout.Food-3.5/5Ambience-4/5Value for money 3.5/5"
4,"Small, cosy, covered rooftop place provides just the right menu for quick bites as well as main course.The view is pretty in the evenings due to glass walls. The ambience is good for a small gathering and hang out. Not exactly the kind of place for fine dining.It doesn't seem to be like a popular hang out. It is hard to even know if a cafe is existing there.Having Zomato gold membership works out well. It was due to that we identified the place and went till there to utilise the benefit. Thank you Zomato for the Gold :-) !!We tried Veg Steak, pasta, pizza and sizzler.They provide thin crust pizza. All the dishes were good and we enjoyed the food.Giving 4 because the service was slower than expected. It could improve.All in all its a quiet place and food price is slightly on the higher side considering the ambience and quantity but it's worth it since it tastes good. One could give it a try."
4,Small cozy rooftop cafe with a wide spread menu. Not the place for a huge gang. Service is as expected. Dishes to try are the range of pizza's. Go to items like burgers and mocktails are also well prepared. For a small place it has more than the required items on the menu. So overall a pleasant experience.
4,Went out to try their burgers and they were pretty good. The ambience was that of a rustic pub and the people are nice. The service is pretty slow.Food - 3.5/5Ambience - 4/5Service - 3.5/5
3,"A small roof top cafe on the main road.Went around 1pm and we were the only people but later came some 7 to 8 people in another 30 minutes.Ordered 2 chicken burgers,which was really good.Service is great.Ambience is cool and fruit beer is alos available here."
2,"Penthouse Cafe is located in Banashankari. It's on the 4th floor and is right opposite to Cafe Coffee Day on the main road. First, the place seems really shady. The entrance is weird and you feel better only after ending up on the 4th floor.The place is really tiny and seems good. Only thing that seemed nice about the place. We had the Nachos, cheese and salsa. The mayo along with this was so runny and milky. The cheese was only on the top layer and the below ones didn't have any. Next up, my friend and I tried the pink sauce pasta. The pasta was overcooked. The sauce wasn't creamy at all. It lacked in taste. It had garlic bread along with it and it tasted decently. But highly disappointed with this place. I took my friend to this place, with a lot of expectations and we were disappointed!"
4,"Situated in upper floor this cafe wasn't much known to me if I wouldn't find it in zomato. It was bit early when we entered hence there were hardly 2-4 ppl in the cafe. A small call place it was with light music. We had ordered veg pasta, BBQ chicken wings, Peri Peri pizza. All tasted good. Pasta could be better. Service was good."
5,Best place to have food and a very friendly staffed cafe... Price is very reasonable and the drinks are really really amazing .... No comments of this cafe as everything was very good...they also have a smoking zone....
1,"Disappointing! A friend of mine had told me its a below average cafe, but I did not believe it looking at the ratings. Visited myself today and he was right. Masala tea was not even brewed and was made out of tea bags which was priced at 120 Rs. Left it after two sips.Pesto Garlic bread was average but was priced at 200 Rs! Virgin mojito tasted like it was just sweet sugar syrup with a hint of lime.Overall not worth the price being charged for the quality of food. Not sure about their other food items as i did not even wanted to venture further when the tea arrived."
4,"3.5 would be the actual rating but would not like to discourage hence 4. There are much better options available surrounded. The place again a rooftop convert to a restaurant, small well done interiors for its type and nice lighting and good view from top during evening... Tried sizzler and rice both were average nothing much to say but okay as an alternative, price not match for what we get..."
4,"A casual and not very expensive dining place in Banashanki which is not very hard to locate.It is a rooftop cafe in the fourth floor giving it a amazing view.We ordered the Nachos Cheese Salsa, BBQ Chicken Grilled Burger and the 'must try' Jalapeno Cottage Cheese Burger.The Nachos were good and I loved the sauce they gave it with.The burgers where really sloppy but super filling in which the BBQ Chicken Grilled Burger was good, quite similar to any other BBQ burgers.But the 'must try' Jalapeno Cottage Cheese Burger is something I wouldn't recommend.Overall they have a great ambiance and an okayish food.Peace."
4,"Easily located. The cafe is on the last floor of the building with cute ambience. Me and my friends went here for some evening coffee and chit chats. It's perfect for catching up friends over a coffee.We ordered Hot chocolate and Mocha Latte. Mocha Latte was good, had a perfect blend of chocolate and coffee. Hot chocolate on the other than was decent nothing extraordinary.Staff was friendly and courteous.Would visit to try more."
1,If possible I would give even less. The pizza is horrible as they serve it on pre-cooked pizza bread. Makes the pizza super chewy. The worst of all was the main that we ordered. They gave us raw chicken and when complied about it they just cooked the same chicken again making it over cooked and super chewy. Would not recommend it to anyone.
4,"A nice, tiny and cozy place. Amazing food, especially the thin crust pizza, affordable menu and good staff makes the overall experience memorable. A good place for occasional chit chats."
4,One of the best cafe to try pizza in!Though ambience isn't really that great...food compensates for it!Service is 1/5 ....they take minimum of 20 mins to serve a dish.Pocket friendly menu.
4,This is a rooftop cafe with a great view and ambience. I loved the pizzas here. You must absolutely try their Nutella shake I loved it. Their hot chocolate wasn't strong enough.I ordered a That paneer lover pizza. It was amazing. It had a thin crust and all flavors were well balanced. I also ordered a Chicago lover pizza. This pizza too was simply amazing. I think pizzas are safe but at this place. Also their vegetable sizzler is brilliant!!! The pesto pizza is average. They also serve brilliant chovolate shake!
4,Good ambience. Good food. Good music but repetative. Great service. Amazing staff. This place is worth a second visit. Sandwiches and pizzas are good.
3,"Visited this place, as we were really hungry... We ordered a pasta and a pizza...both were quite average I dint like it that much, they need a little bit of improvement... Service was pretty okay it is rooftop cafe , a small place with a average decor!!Service - 3.5/5Food - 3/5Ambience - 3/5Would I visit this place again - No"
3,"Amazing view, simple and nice arrangement and a good quality of food is all that I want to say.Visited here on a Sunday evening and found place to be silent and nice, I do not see much a crew then the order placement and the service was slow. Ordered for a veg nacho's and devil's eye (egg), they almost took 30 more mins to serve these two. they have no beverages on that particular day to serve.Nacho's was tasty enough to visit again nd devils eye wasn't bad either.Tips: Service should be quick"
3,"Very good chocolate flavored ice cream sizzler! Nacho pizza was good.Things here are a bit pricey. They can improve on their Ambience as the place looks a bit claustrophobic and it requires a good amount of ventilation inside, things tend to get smokey due to the sizzlers. Salt to injuries, service was sluggish as they took too long to prepare the dishes though there only a few in the cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå©. I hope they get good experience out of this and improve in future.Taste 3.5/5Hygiene 3.5/5Price 3/5Ambience 2/5Serving size 3/5Service 3/5"
4,"Amazing cafe,Top floor, no outdoor seating.Food is delicious, though the quantity is okayish.I ordered 6 dishes.Cheese balls are yum.Pink pasta is okay okay.Garlic bread is delicious too.French fries was bad.Nachos Pizza was okayish.Overall, a nice place to give a try."
1,"Located opposite to wildcraft store..this place is on the 4th floor.The ambience is not good..feels very congested.Well for starters, we had nachos cheese salsa which was okay. We ordered some garlic bread with cheese. A complete disappointment as it just had some processed cheese and the bread was dipped in ghee.We ordered some chicken Alfredo hoping it would be better but to our disappointment, it turned out worse than the garlic bread. The Kentucky killing pizza was the worst dish ever made. Hot chocolate was quite good. Lychee punch was okay. Rest was horrible. This place does not even have a proper place for hand wash.Food-1/5Service and staff-2/5Ambience-1/5Hope they really improve."
3,"Service is little slow and food is fine. You won't be disappointed much , parking facility I could not locate. Staff can be little more local speaking , it was little difficult to converse. Overall not a bad experience."
3,"Only few selected pizzas are gud.rest everything is frozen food deep fried .Good place hangout with friend,cheap price but food is not that good."
3,Hot steaming Hyderabadi Biryani... Tasty and not that spicy ... People who want less spicy food can go here... Very friendly staff....Car parking is not available so pls take Ur bikes... preferred for bachelors...
2,paneer Manchurian had 6 pieces of paneer for 80 rs
1,The food is very spicy especially fried rice and noodles and we had to prepare at home for kids as kids could not even eat a spoon of it. Generally Schezwan version is spicy but this is the spiciest fried rice and noodles I have ever had.
2,Too much spicy and tasteless
2,very less quantity
5,awesome food thanks
1,Very bad experience Yesterday I ordered mushroom fried rice there is no mushroom and quantity is very less and taste also not good late delivery
1,"Very bad experience,I ordered mushroom fried rice there is no mushroom and quantity is very less"
1,oily food
5,AWEsOMe FOOOOOD! Enjoyed it!! On time ! hot hot! .. nice man..????
2,quantity was very less according to price. taste is average.
4,"good taste to the food, Gobi Manchurian was great"
1,very oily n quantity is less
5,"Gobi Manchurian was really tasty and crispy,quantity is less.. Sufficient for one.. But considering the price dat low its justifiable.."
2,quantity was less for the given money.... Taste was ok...
3,taste wise Good
1,not good food wast of money .food is full of oil not good to eat .plz don't ever order from this bad restaurant
1,worst food i ever ate
1,"worst food ,worst packaging"
5,tqsm... NYC??
5,RATED gud
4,I have not got extra onion and lemon
3.5,"A small kiosk kind of a Place serves good Indo Chinese stuff. I happened to try their Fried Rice, It was tasted decent with right flavours. Whereas, Gobi Manchurian was too good again with right texture and right spice level. The prices are pocket friendly and good portion size. A preferred outlet!bangaloreepicure.com"
4,Good foodLess quantity
3,"A small eatery located adjacent to subway opposite BDA complex. This place is quiet popular among college goers for it's Chinese quick bites .Have been to this place numerous times just because it's easy on the pocket. The food here tastes bland and not at all appetising. All in all,just an average place."
5,"Aloo Manchuri, Tava paneer and tangy aloo twist is the yummy one :) Just love this place ? very reasonable ? best place to come with family and friends ? Just awesome ??"
4,Small place next to subway In banashankari.ordered schezwan gobi it was yummy. Followed by french fries with pepper salt. this was Also good. then went on to order chilly cheese sandwhich which was also nice followed by mango malai.i think this was little old or too much freezed because paper wrap was fully struck on kulfi it took sometime for me to completely get rid of paper from kulfi. But taste was fine. Then finally ordered mixed gola. unfortunately gola stick was not there so they asked me if it was ok to give it in cup i was ok with it.one draw back is no place to sit.but overall cheap and best place to visit now and then.
4.5,My friends are vegetarians and one day an usual evening walk n we hopped in here.The special sandwich was killer. Gobi apt and potato twist with cheese sauce was yum. Must try again for street food lovers
5,Nice hotel Nice taste...the quality of the food and the taste is good and the price of the food is also available with low price overall good place for food..
3.5,"Potato is one of the most versatile vegetables, which tastes awesome in almost all forms;  and if you are a potato lover then Aloo Twist is a must try here. As the name suggests, a potato is de-skinned and twisted around a stick and baked. The chilli and tangy forms are the best. Its something different and I end up asking my friends to try it too. Sandwitch, Fried Rice and Gobi Manchuri are also spoken high of. Their Kulfis are quite unique and coconut Kulfi in particular is a killer. Its a very small place so don't expect much seating wise, but people are quite friendly. I wonder why there are so less reviews for this place though this place is always crowded with people and Swiggy orders.  Waiting to go back and try their other dishes."
4.5,Very tiny but serves tasty good.Potato twist and Manchuris are my recommendationsYou can try the place if you are not very particular about hygiene.The staff is also very friendly.
3.5,"Small place opposite BDA park, near SLV. The food is cheap over here and I keep visiting the place after my office hours. The quantity is pretty good for one person and I like the paneer and gobi manchurian over here. The noodles and fried rice is very oily. So avoid it. Just stick to the starter. The bread used for sandwich is the regular one so not stomach filling but very tasty. In all a nice place to go when you don't want to spend too much and also want to fill your appetite.theroaminggastronomer.wordpress.com"
3,The chinese food in here is really bland. Not that much tasteful. The Shezwan noodles has no shezwan taste except the red colour. Tge only plus point is that the rates are very cheap.
4.5,"Everything tastes so good here.its a perfect place for a foodie who loves Gobi,Noodles,Sandwiches.Quality and Quantity truly matches with the cost of the items !!!Ohh yes even kulfi 's too ?"
3.5,"A small fast food place near to BDA complex.. They have only few items on their menu but its worth to taste and even the prices are affordable.. However, the drawback is that they will take a lot of time due to the limited resource and there is no seating so u can wait patiently.."
5,ruchis point nice place to eat alootwist spicy and tasty and Chinese items also superb and mainly value for ur money pls visit this restaurant @banashankari 2nd stage next to slv hotel and subway..
5,"It is a very good place for food lovers,My favourite is ALOOTWISTERS TANGY WITH CHEESE AND PANNER AND ALOO MANCHURIAN? it is clean and hygienic"
5,"Hi ruchis point nice place to eat Chinese items,money saving in this fast food restaurant special in this restaurant aloo Manchurian guys pls visit this restaurant ruchis point banashankari 2nd stage..next to slv hotel and subway"

5,"Ruchi' point is a wonderful fast food place located @ Banashankari 2nd stage near BDA Complex.... Taste is yummy there ... Decent place and quality is good .... Pricing is very cheap based on the food you get there .... Aloo twist is one of the best which I liked the most ..... You also get Gobi, aloo,panneer Manchurians..... Guys please visit this place and share your experience..."
4,"A small snack joint right beside Subway, generally crowded. The menu is quite simple.The pricing is decent, definitely won't damage your pocket. The quantity is somewhat ok for the price.The food is delicious. Really really good food.The aloo Manchurian is really tasty, so is gobi Manchurian and mushroom Manchurian.Veg sandwich wasn't all that great.The main drawback - they take forever. I kid you not. We had to wait half an hour because they kept messing up the orders. They don't have a billing system. What they are currently doing is inefficient.If you are in a hurry, please don't order for food here. You'll regret it.Hopefully they make changes and introduce more varieties."
5,"Very tasty food, pricing is also good, place is very clean and hygienic as well, it is worth your money, best place for light evening snack."
4.5,"Ruchi's a best snacky place in Banashankari ! Value for money, tastes really good ! But the shop space is very small, its kinda uncomfortable to stand n eat there ! They serve hot foods that adds extra taste !"
3.5,Been here for buffet lunch with a big team. One of the good veg buffets in Jayanagara. Have plenty dishes in the list & most of it are worth the try.
4,"We had been there for breakfast... Breakfast buffet is really nice...Mixed fruit juice and vanilla milkshakeCupcakes, slice cake, veg sandwich, cut fruitsIdli, vada with tomato chutney n coconut chutney... It was really nice..Cheese garlic balls.. It was very tasty..Chole... Along with bhatura..they were serving hot hot bhaturas on your table..Baked beansMoong dal halwa..They do serve dosas on your table.. We asked for plain dosa n masala dosa.. It was good but was very oily..Ambience is good n it is clean as well..A must try place!!"
4,"It was a good experienceGood service, except the soups(tomato and vegetables noodle soup) all other dishes were good. We hadpaneer Afghani Tikka -4/5Rajasthani roti, stuffed paratha, garlic naan 4/5Bhutta palak something dish was very nice 5/5Corn Pulav 4/5Ambience is okay, good service.Valet parking available."
3,A decent place for vegetarians but they should try to be more consistent with their taste.We were served cold starters and the taste was just okay.This place surely needs improvement.
4,This is a good place and has a little parking problems!! Quiet costly for small events.. but if it is for a big day then u can try it out here !! The food is very tasty and on point to our expectations..
3,Little dull but beautiful interior! Food was kind of okay ish not that great.Kind of on the expensive side. It's was an okay experience.We had crispy fingers which was basically fried ladies finger. Wasn't that impressive. Did expect something more. The tandoor items were good as any other place.Food - 3/5Ambience- 3/5Service - 3.5/5
3,"Place is a little dull with dim lighting. We sat in a corner where they had a comfortable bench in the corner for privacy. They also have regular tables and chairs. Coming to the menu they have north indian and Chinese dishes. We ordered manchow soup, veg crisp, crispy corn, paneer satay. The manchow soup was average with no strong taste. The veg crisp was very oily. Crispy corn was tasty. Even the paneer satay on a stick was quite good with good amount of spice. It had nice masala on it. In main course we ordered ghee pulkas with veg makhanwala. The pulkas were soft. The curry was okay. Service was fine. Rates average. Altogether okay experience."
1,"I got the red velvet cupcakes which said they used ""Philadelphia Cream Cheese"" which wasn't that at all. I've had the same cream cheese before so many times and that wasn't it. It wasn't even red velvet cake. It was just a normal sponge vanilla cake that was dyed a horrible red colour just to make it look like ""red velvet"" cake. I've been blogging about food for quite a while now and I have never come across such a bad cupcake. I cannot believe this restaurant tries to pass off a knock off red velvet cupcake as the real one."
2,"I ordered for South Meals. But, I been delivered with North meals at ?35 extra. I had to pay extra and take North meal as I had already paid in advance for south meals. isnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât this awesome!So, not worth ordering again!"
4,"Must try chilli garlic rice and white sauce pasta, its awesome, I tried both dishes which was fresh and tasty, quality of food was also up to the mark. Delivery bit late but worth to taste. Should improve in packing. GOOD EXPERIENCEFOOD :4/5SERVICE :4/5QUALITY:4/5"
3,"Located very near to Jayanagar National College, it's a small outlet with a couple of chairs to sit and eat. It's a self service place which serves some reasonably good fast food at a very reasonable price. Their pan pizzas, garlic bread and sandwich are good."
5,"This place is really awesome. Its affordable and taste is also good. I had a mayonise sandwich. It was awesome and burger is also great, and it's a known place for tea. Whenever you are near Gandhi Bazar don't miss to taste this. It's something different"
5,Awesome.....!!!!!!!. Next to McDonalds but the burger is way better than McDonald's. I love it..... Personally best burger I ever had..... And even chocolate tea is recommended here as well but before have it just add a pinch of sugar and stir it well..... Than the delecasy is served......
3.5,"Items I've tried - Oreo shake, French fries, chocolate ice cream, sandwiches, burgers.The place is pretty clean, but there is no indoor seating. The items are priced well and the portions are of a good quantity. Good for a small bite."
4,Nice masala chai. Good sandwiches. Quite a new place. No indoor seating thought. Me and my wife happened to have chai here on a rainy Bangalore evening.
3,Just tried chocolate ice cream here and it was good.My friend had lassi here and even he told it was good. But next time when v went for lassi they were out of lassi and had to settle for milkshake. It's a new joint and it goes very easy on your pocket. A cool hangout place with friends especially for BMSCE students
3,"Chai Mane is a small kiosk is located right next to Hyundai Showroom & beside HSBC bank in busy Gandhi Bazzar. They serve good Tea's, Crushers, Ready to fry snacks like French fries, smilies, wedges and Sandwiches at pocket friendly prices. I got to try Masala Chai and Vada Pav. Masala Chai was very good. However, Vada Pav is just ok. Since the Vada wasn't so hot & may be they have made way early before they were serving to customers. I recommend this place definitely for Chai/Teabangaloreepicure.com"
4,"Chai Mane!A brand new Chai makers in the city, with their own taste and standards. Located on Gandhi Bazar main road, next to Blue Hyundai.They have a decent menu, which has categories like Hot Chai, Cold Chai, Hot Coffee, Cold Coffee, Crush, Shakes, Eatables, Burgers and Sandwiches. It's just not a chai shop, we get quick bite fast foods too.Tasted Ginger Chai, which was served quick, within minutes. Chai was really refreshing with the ginger flavour.A decent and quick bite place to end up for any pocket friendly times.Planning to soon and try other variates from the menu."
3,"Not so great on any thing, regular menu and regular upachar. Can grab some quick bits but nothing else. Not even in the first ten options that i can come up with in the area"
4,"Order food via Swiggy, packing good, but quantity is less i felt. I asked for extra choco sauce dint see it. Other wise tase is good not that bad. Taste 7.5/10. Packing can improve."
4,"A very nice place, not very spacious though. The staffs are very jolly & friendly & greet you really well. The food is great and the price is reasonable. A lot of options in the menu. A must visit place."
4,BIRIYANI!! It's not just food it's an emotion!!! That's slogan for all us biriyani lovers?Ever got fed up or disappointed for not getting a place in Shivaji Military Hotel..worry not this place which is around 100-200 mts from that place has biriyani which tastes almost the same as Shivaji (lets stress on the almost a bit more?) the chicken is tender and the starters are good too..if you're not lucky enough to get a seat at Shivaji or not a person who likes a lot of crowd can go to this place.Heard a rumour that a person working in Shivaji quit a job and started this..not sure if it's true or not??My reviewFood 4/5Ambience 3/5Cost for 2 400-500
5,Best food ever. Great food . Good food awesome food. 5 star food . 6 star food. 7 star food. All star food. That's seven start food. Awesome food.
5,"The best place for you if you are low on cash, the quality is good and the taste is even better.Their speciality is bun samosa and cold coffee but my personal favourite are bread omelette and banana shake,definitely worth your money and time and also a good place for hanging out with your friends."
4,"Right outside PES college, Stop 'N' Joy 's bun samosa and Oreo shake combo is a rage. I've myself gone there almost every week for this very own combo. This place never fails to amuse me. Their cheese Maggi, Cold coffee, Capsicum sandwich, Oreo shake, All variants of bun samosa are super yum. The only issue, as we all know, is the hygiene. The place is not very hygienic and I've heard thousands of tales of weird rodents around the place. But tbh, that can be present anywhere and being a foodie, that never stopped me from going there, ever.If you ever go to PES (for whatever reason), you definitely need to visit this place and have the combo."
1,packing was not good and I ordered dal kichadi they didn't gave raita and spoon I saw this after delivering and I called to delivery boy but call not connecting
1,Order wasnt right and it was smelling
1,"Last 6months before I had briyani here. That good. Based on that, I went with my family. I got worst experience?. Very worst food. I ordered faluda and special faluda?, hyderabadi briyani (green color) and kasmiri briyani(orange color) ?. Those all are worst taste and preparation also not tolerable. It spoiled our weekend dinner."
5,food was really good
3,I ordered for rice and a juice. The juice was very bad and bitter.
4.5,They serve crispy manchoorians (baby corn pepper dry) is a must tryPaneer fried rice is just yumm with fried paneer bits in every spoon??
1,"The worst food I have ever had.. the butter naan was like some kind rubber.. that elastic.. they should change the name of their cream of mushroom soup to boiled mushroom with water.. only the gravy was good thankfully.. the last 2 times I ordered from this pace, they sent really good food.. but this time it was ?????.. I had a mouthful to listen from my parents since I ordered from such a sick place through Swiggy.. request you all to never order from here!"
5,Fantastic place to visit with good infrastructure and excellent Taste and Service. I have visited many times and I'm never disappointed. A very good place to visit with friends and family. My most favourite food here is Chinese and Starters.

4.5,Very delicious curry and cooked well !!They have brown and white bread optionsA must try for quick snacks and veg foodiesRajma curry is yummyyy!!
3,"This is a small place in Jayanagar 4th block, AmmaÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs pastry road.It offers bunny chow, a dish from South Africa. And there are 3 options for now, all vegetarian.ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs basically a curry, paneer, Rajma(?) and soya chunks inside a loaf of bread.ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs nothing great, decent taste and not too heavy on the pockets.Would love to have some more variety."
4,"Very small and adorable ambience. Ordered chicken nuggets, zinger burger and Cesar salad which was all delicious. Budget friendly. Lovely service. Good food. Presentation of the food is really good.epicuresdelight.blogspot.com"
4,Taste was amazing
5,Mahalakshmi is my fav bavkary from my Mysore days.
5,"super taste , best packing"
1,"This was once my favorite spots for sweets n oll. But from last two deliveries, they are like too careless.. I got cold jalebis once. And the last time I was waiting for 2hrs, at last had to cancel the order."
5,excellent delivery
5,I loved their filter Coffee....it was just puurfect... It's location is also good since it's in main road. Service is quick and it's budget friendly.
5,We love their filter coffee! I personally love their sweet and salt cookies which cost just 5 bucks each!It's a very small outlet on the Main Road and it's super clean and affordable.
4,Grill chicken and shawarma is one on the best u can get .All the grill and tandoori items are the best.1)lollipop2) shawarmaMy personal favorite is grill chicken .the hotel staff are very polite and welcoming.U can ask the chef personally how ur food should be cooked.
4,"I happened to order food from this place once because it had an offer. To my surprise, the food was epic. Way more than what I expected from a budget place.I've ordered from Ivy thrice and have had a great experience always. I've tried their Paneer tikka, paneer butter masala, mushroom masala, veg fried rice, schezwan veg fried rice and roti. Everything has been top notch. It takes about 30-40 mins to get delivered to my house. This had become like my go to place if I want to a pocket friendly meal. I'd definitely recommend that place. I'll also pay a visit in person soon to see how their dine in service is."
3,"Had been for reviewing here!Well,the place is just located opposite to the National college in jayanagar 7th block.This cafe welcomes you with the plants kept outside which I really liked.The place is small and clean with cute little seatings :)Food:1)Garlic bread with cheese: was crispy and cheesy and was really consistent!2)pesto Melody pizza: I loved the flavor of the pizza. It had all capsicum toppings which was yummy. But,I felt it was salty.3) Lasagna a la Mexicana: it was salty. Could have been better.4)Choco mug with vanilla ice cream: I would really recommend you all to order this!This was the best.The mug had hot chocolate brownie which was topped on by vanilla ice cream. It was deliciously delicious ?.Service: was kinda quick."
4,"Cute cafe located in Jayanagar, good food with cute ambience. An apt place to grab a quick lunch. We had coffee and sandwiches, I really liked it. Actually, my visit to this place was a happy accident."
4,It's a veg cafe!! One who is roaming around national college of Jayanagar visit once this place for carving!!?Brilliant Ambience with friendly staffs!! Each and every recipe (Except Soup) which we ordered were good at its taste!!?Started from Tomoato SoupGarlic breadCheese BallsNuggetsPastaAnd pizza!! ?Prices are reasonable compared to surrounding cafes!! Personally I liked this place!!?Overall 4.5/5#mustvist @cafe airos
4,"Looking for a place for a quick lunch, we landed at this small cafe. They mixed up our orders, but were sweet enough to rectify their mistake. The pastas were simple and delicious. The best part is that they have half portions too. The iced tea was average and the mushroom cheese bombs were good. Coming to the pricing, it is quite reasonably priced making it a good option if you are looking for a budget friendly place."
5,"Believe it or not, I have been ordering in from Airos everyday for a week now. I'm in love with their pasta and quick service when it comes to delivery. They have half and full portions. Half is more than enough for one person but if you feel like diving into a huge bowl, by all means, go for the full portion. Their Arrabiata is absolutely perfect - tangy, balanced and spicy. I rarely ever have Alfredo as most places make it too milky or bland. This by far compares to the best Alfredo I have had. And their Aglio Olio is a classic choice. Looking forward to dining in and having a lasagna next time."
4,Stopped for a quick bite here and had an excellent experience. The extra hot sandwich really hits the spot in terms of heat and freshness. The mint cooler was subtle and great as well. Great place.
5,This review is based on online order.I was searching for the veg restaurant which serve pizza and noticed this italian restaurant.I ordered classic Margarita Pizza and Garlic Bread.Both were excellent in taste. Especially Garlic Bread which was yummy.Pizza was of thin crust and tasted great.Packing was excellent andTotally worth for money.Definitely love to visit this place and try other varieties.
4,"The bright yellow interior gives a vibrant & warm feeling, just like the sun. Service was prompt and the waiters are attentive. Was only able to try their drinks & shakes and it was nice. A very pocket-friendly cafe !! and definitely worth another visit."
4,"Ginger Chai and masala Chai were amazing ??They prepare coffee in brass utensils, nice vibes.RecommendedTaste 5/5Hygiene 4.5/5Serving size 4/5Price 3.5/5"
4,"They make tea from natural flower extracts???? Purple classic and blue brew in hot tea were totally refreshing?.?? I personally loved their Cranberry ice tea??.??They serve snacks like upma, puff and Maggie noodles too.??Tea lovers don't miss it.You should definitely visit this place!"
4,"""CHAI KRAFT"" sounds Interesting...situated in Jayanagar 4th block opposite Maiyas...a great place to hang out...wide Variety of a Tea/coffee/ cold shakes are available....Banana Cake is more tastly and i loved it...must try it once surely u will love it....and we Orderd a Purple tea and Dum chai.... Purple Tea is one of the best tea it was quite good.....One of the finest chai shop in the locality.....cost wise its not much Costlier ...and Worthy too....All in all a good option if u r looking for a freshly brewed Chai in Jayanagar which has a plethora of Filter coffee places,,, this place is a welcome change....My Recommendation is order a Dhabeli in kedias fun food just next door and quaff it down with a Purple tea or a Dum chai ...Ambience: Interior is good but no seating available inside the shop...rating for ambience is 3.5/5 ."
4,Indeed a good place. This place is not very posh but calm place to hangout. It is just below the southend metro station . The food here is really affordable & the quality as well as quantity is up to the mark. The prices of the liquor is also nominal. Masala papad n baby corn manchuri is our all time favorite which is always accompanied by one large budwiser ??. The staff here are very kind and they do good service. Food is prepared quite quickly and served.
4,The best restaurant around jayanagar for perfect blend multi cuisine.They have wide range of food options and recently they have upgraded their menu.Love their presentation and the yummy flavors. The only thing that this place misses out is on Tom kha but never mind they have other things to focus on.ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâDum murghÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ - cheesy chicken served in matka is a must try.Food - 4.5/5Ambience - 4.5/5Value for money - 4/5
3.5,"A good looking ambience. Rooftop is really good and a chill out place to hang out with friends.Food is decent, not very great though.Service is pretty fast.Overall an okay experience."
1,"Amazing place to go WASTE money.Nothing we ordered was near to 'ok' type dish.They served us RAW cheese balls and had the audacity to argue that its the way it is to be eaten. Potato wedges were another hate crime. Pasta was as though it had sugar in it and tasted like gue.Nobody were kind, it was as though we were invisible.Only the ambience is great, you can sit in the Balcony and have the breeze on your face and is pretty romantic.Food - 0/5 negativeAmbience - 4.5/5Service - 1/5Rates - 2/5Not at all recommend."
3,"There was a long waiting time for the food to get ready, we had ordered just basic north Indian and South Indian meals. The food taste was just mediocre. We also tried Arabian pulpy juice, as per the brand.... it was yum."
4,Yesterday it was almost 10.30am still gave a try here... idly was ok... vada was nice.Chutney was really good. Sambhar average. Its a self service outlet and quick. Rates are ok.Aloo palya masala dosa was over so had sagu masala..it was ok..nice.
5,"The Krishna grand Xpress is the Best place in Bangalore for breakfast , lunch , dinner , snacks and chats.Good ambiance.Good taste.Reasonable price.Love this place."

5,Love the food here! Fast service and the pepper paneer is so delicious that i can practically eat it everyday! All dishes are very good! Mushroom Curry and Masala Dosa are something you shouldnt miss!
3,"Morning been here for breakfast, vada was so tasty , bele baat was ok but masala dosa? very bad.. even aloo sabzi also bad.. service is good well Maintained hotel and.. try to provide taste dosa , I took pomegranate juice it was very good.."
4,Good tast
2.5,An average place to have cheap veg food. This place is clean and quiet crowded during peak hours. Tasted their filter coffee and gobi manchurian which was quite good. Overall a budget place to have food if visiting nearby.
3.5,"This is a small place near kiims college, maybe not really walkable but a good option in comparision to different college canteens available in the premises. Here u can get anything from north indian to south indian to chinese. I cannot guarantee about the chinese but south indian and north indian is more than eatable infact good. I mostly prefer idly, bisibele bath, kadai paneer, naan and few more things. Naan wont be that good might even feel a little tight so it would be better to go with butter naan. Overall food is ok for once a while visit. This place is mostly crowded and hot so be prepared in advanced. Pricing is reasonable."
1,This is definitely a must visit if you are in this area. This is just on the Street adjoining the Infamous Thindi Street. Very tasty food and good service to accompany it. Had lunch here last week and definitely loved it.The Butter Naan Curry is a must try here.Revised Review - Had Puri here this afternoon. Tasted like Papad. The restaurant owner said that's how it is. Must Not visit restaurant anymore.foodnwine.in
5,"Great food and must try the Gulab Jamun here - Highly recommended :) The south Indian food is great indeed, the best part is that the dosa's here are pocket friendly and costs just 20 bucks !!!!!"
4.5,Super tasty and crispy Jalebi and authentic Hilal jamuns made in pure ghee!The owners and very careful about quality and supervise most processes!
4.5,Taste of the sandwiches is vry yummy And a nice place to spend time ... Every time we wanna have some sandwiches this is the first place we always choose ... Its vry near to our place so we think this is the best place for hangout ...
5,"Another interesting eatery added to the many already present in jayanagar/Basavangudi area! A little different from the others as Shringar offers you both western and Indian snacks. The sandwiches are tasty. I loved the Indian sweets like the jamoon, Kaju Katli and Jelibi. Even the carrot halwa is something one must try. For a quick bite to a leisure outing, Shringar is the place you must try. Located right next to the Southend circle metro station, its a convenient place for all.  I found the place to be well maintained and staff efficient."
5,Happened to visit this nice cozy eatery after a friend's recommendation. Shringar has lip smacking hot Jalebis made with pure ghee and saffron. Another must try are the sandwiches and Bombay styled pav bhaji. A must visit if you are around this part of the town.
5,"Shringar is located right behind the upcoming, South end circle Metro station. The place is clean and food neatly prepared. We mainly tried the sandwiches like the Chinese, Russian and the spinach corn sandwichs. They were all delicious. They tasted like nothing we had tasted before particularly the Chinese sandwich.The hot jalebis are the highlight and a must try! This place is perfect to get a quick tasty food during rush hours. Super pocket friendly, so all the bachelors/students out there, you must visit this place for a quick snack.Over all Tasty and fresh!"
5,One of the best places to visit in Basavanagudi. The services to the ambiance and most importantly the Hygiene  is perfect to one's taste. The chats /sweets are freshly made and has a very homely taste which makes customers like us to visit the place more frequently. The HOT JILABI is the best you can find in Bangalore. Highly recommended place for best Indian sweets in town!!
4,Avarekalu dosa 1 st time tried it was awesome ! Udupi grand tea like Kadak tea awesome just like home tea . Also ambiance nice . Dosa Avarekalu with texture with Coconut chatni .
5,no better food can be served from any place
2,food quality is very poor
5,super fast ...like to order again
2,Ordered 2 plates of Pani Puri...but only got 7 Pcs in total. I believe that is the qty for 1 plate.
1,I got an incomplete order
5,The food was amazing and the delivery didn't take much time.
4,fried rice was not tastey
5,good taste
1,didn't receive the food
3,Ambience is okay okay. Food is good not as great. Simple menu card no more options. Complete south treat you can get here from the menu if you see.
5,This place serves good Udupi style cuisine. I like the vegetable Biryani that they serve here which is a must try. Ordering delivery is the way to go as the place is always crowded during morning and evening hours.
1,not delivered
5,yummy
2,"We ordered Palak paneer, pulao.Masala Dosa and coffee from this restaurant to try out their veg North and South Indian selection and because this place has newly opened in Basavangudi. The taste of the masala dosa was good and coffee was fine, however the Palak paneer which did taste good when I took the first bite but while eating some more of it, I found a piece of plastic in it and I was shocked. I am hesitant of trying this place any more!"
5,Healthy
5,"Excellent food, fast service, quality was awesome"
5,thank you for delivering before the expected time. appreciate it!
4,tasty food..Akki rotti n shavige
4,"A fairly new addition to the long list of Darshinis of Basavanagudi!Ambience - It is a self service place with a little seating area which can accommodate about 30 people. There are tables as well where you can stand and eat like any other self service place. The interiors are a little different with some unique roof lighting. They have a separate juice and a chats counter as well.Service - The person at the counter was polite and once you place the order, food arrives in just few minutes.Food - There is a wide variety of menu. They have South Indian, North Indian, Chinese, Sandwiches, Juices and chats.I had been here for a quick bite before lunch so just ordered a plate of Idly Sambar. It was fresh and hot. Idly was soft and the Sambar was tasty.Should visit again to try their Chinese and North Indian menu. A pocket friendly place which is worth every penny!"
1,handi Biryani is full of mushroom which we don't eat atall
5,Very good! Packing was okay. Food is excellent.
3,Sitting area is available. Staff behaviour is okayish. Food is also not that bad. If you are in the area & looking for a quivk veg eat might consider it.
5,na

3.5,Very tasty coffee. Average fried rice. Good Gobi Manchurian. Average ambience.road touched easy to find. Not that clean in non Ac area. Parking is a big problem.
3.5,A good place to go to for a nice meal. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs inexpensive and serves a good quantity and gives good quality food.The South Indian cuisine here is really nice to eat and taste good.
4,awesome food
1,"I wish I could give them zero stars.Shame on them tat they are from udupi.They could not even make an average north indian meal.Both the sabzi was exactly same base( veg kadai n paneer tikka masala) both tasting horrible.got some foreign object in baby corn manchurian.The rotis were like they were made 2 days ago.Veg pulav n shajahi pulav was like made at home( sticky,lumped rice, tasted like puffed rice ) flavour less..Had to throw most of the food with still a bad aftee taste n horrible morning.Definetely not a place for north indian especially take away/home delivery."
1,Delivery Boy unable to find location
4,gud & tasty
4.5,Good food at pocket-friendly prices. Getting a seat during weekends is difficult.Ideal to grab a quick bite on weekdays. Meal combos are great value-for-money.
4,Udupi grandThis place is a newbie in this stretch. Serves just veg food ..been there tried their veg biryani and it was neat and nice .. less oily and spices added did give the right punch. Apt location and decent menu.Will visit again.
3.5,"Udupi people are ruling over Bangalore city with their authentic tatses in different restaurants named after them.This is one of the hotel which falls into the category of darshinis and udupi franchises of Bangalore.Its located exactly opposite to Nagasandra Bus stop near Basavanagudi.Its hardly 2kms from my home,and a fast serving restaurant with ample seating arrangements with good food.Coffee is the best part here,they serve the best filter coffee which is rich in taste and aroma :) It's all under one roof restaurant with south Indian,north Indian,chinese and other dishes.Its a self service hotel.Must try Dosa here is Rava Dosa.Food : 3.5/5Ambience : 3.5/5Service : Self ;)"
4.5,"Very nice place and really friendly staff... I did go here 5 (during different days of the week and time) before posting my review. The best part is the quality and quantity of food. But parking is a problem, I suggest you avoid taking your car."
3.5,"Located at Prime area in Basavangudi near South End, went here for lunch, the restaurants is trying to offer seating in a very small place and hence its pretty congested. It still has couple of standing tables if you are unlucky enough to not been able to catch a seat for you. Well that's ok as long as food is good which is not bad at all. We tried south Indian meal and Curd Rice and both were in pretty good quantity and with decent taste.

3.5,"This place servers multi cusines, South Indian, north Indian, Chinese food. Well maintained hygiene throughout the restaurant. Good for morning breakfast, and evening snacks. They also prepare chats, sandwiches and fresh fruit juice. Good place, fast service, pocket friendly, fresh and tasty food."
3.5,"We visited this Fast food restaurant for breakfast. We ordered Poori saagu, Onion Dosa and Idli sambar. All the food items were tasty and up to the expectation. Saagu and chutney served with these tasted good. Onion Dosa was less oily though I had not mentioned while ordering."
4.5,The roti curry was good mixed with crispy gobi manchuri it was an mind blowing afternoon (?heavy #burplicious food dude ?Just that it is crowded most of the times so that's a heads up.
4,"Good foods, tasty.... Reasonable price same like south thindis... Place is neat and clean... Good serving manner.. tea and coffee taste also nice. Simply a good one."
3,"This is a newly opened hotel in nagasandra circle. This place is quite decent enough in terms of cashier courtesy to the food supplying boys behind the counter. Unlike UD, no one shows any kind of attitude or pass any remarks. Probably it's new hence they avoid such altercations. I have tried idly, set dosa, masala dosa, poori n rice bath.. while idly, masala dosa, poori n rice bath is good, wasn't too thrilled with set DOsa. Masala dosa was good for the first time n lacked the crispiness when it had it the second time. Overall a decent place for quick bites.. as stated earlier attitude is better than UD n South kitchen..."
4,A new outlet which has opened near nagasandra circle. had set dosa and vada sambar. Set dosage was very good while vada should have been crisper. Still good. The place is clean and ambience is relaxing. Good option for South Indian food in the area
3.5,"New darshani for competition for UD and ST.. Visit several times, the first was on the opening day.. This has been my time spending place when I am early to pick up my daughter from school.. The place was full packed for few weeks of it's opening now its the other way round.. They have a part hall on the first floor.. Food is okay where few dishes are good and some not.. The first day had roti and curry which was good.. Next time had kulcha and veg curry and jeera rice, rice was dry and not worth it... Babycorn manchurian was good all the 3 times I tried... Pav bhaji was bad when I had it there but the second time when my sister had brought it for me accidentally was good.. Chats are not that great but okay... Overall okay for some time pass fun food.."
4.5,Food taste is comparatively good. They have lot of varieties in single roof. Vegetable Sagu taste is at the higher end. North India rice items are well prepared with unique taste. They have maintained same good quality and taste since beginning.
4,"I visited Ganesh Grand last week along with my family for dinner and we were quite happy with the overall service of the restaurant.This restaurant is run by the famous Ganesh Sweets Chain of Chamrajpet fame.The restaurant is a multi stored building which has party hall, AC seating dining area and Non AC seating ground floor section. We chose to dine in the ac lounge.The interiors were bright and neatly maintained. We started of by ordering Baby Corn Manchrian which was crisp and medium spicy. Our next order was Butter Naan, Kulchas and Veg Kohlapuri.The Naan and kulcha were very soft and buttery and the gravy was very rich and thick and was a delight.Our next order was Tawa Pulav which was served alongside Raitha and was upto the expectation.They serve good quality food and the pricing is very reasonable which makes it a very good and a dependable option.Ambience - 4Food quality - 4Food quantity - 3.5Staff - 3.5Pricing - 4"
3,Its situated in Chamrajpet. Both self service and service hall there. Ambience is ok but very low cleanliness. Food is ok. Prices are not high. Taste is just ok.
4.5,"If you are looking for a authentic home made food then this is your hardstop.You can try the idly and vada with variety of rice every day then in the afternoon you can taste the Ragi ball I.e., mudde or chapatti meals with variety of payasaAlso you will get tasty and lip smacking burgers here the maharaja burger is very famous try once"

I love the place and the food. every Sunday rituals is to visit this place .ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs late night no worries letÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs rush to little cafe and grab our food and have a good sleep .If hunger strikes this cafe comes in mind ?
3,"As the name suggests it's a small cafe in V.V.Puram. The place has nice interiors and is quite attractive. They have a vast menu which includes Pizza, sandwiches, pasta, rice/noodles, desserts and many more.Ordered for a pizza and a grill sandwich. While the pizza was good enough, the grill sandwich was below average. I found the price of lot of items really high. I mean 120/- for a grill sandwich is just way too high. They really need to work out their pricing.Service is quick and the owner managing the place is really friendly."
4,"Tried chocolate ,pista,mango kulfi for kids..they really enjoyed it ..and custard falooda ice cream was also good ...need to try kesar lassi next time"
4,"Small shop with decent price and good desserts (if only fresh). Like every store, it has pros and cons. Their hot menus are good (gulab jamoon, kajar halwa ). In cold ghulkand, Malawi, anjeer kulfis, rabdi are good. I felt rose and badam milks are overpriced."
1,Food was spoilt.
1,missing food items
1,One of the worst place.I ordered rabadi and rass malai and now I'm down with food poisoning.I called the owner and made it clear to make it fresh and make sure about the hygiene.I would request you'll if you're reading this then please don't go.
4,"My favorite Indian dessert?Doodh pheni is a smiple dessert made up of pheni and sweet badam milk??Mumbai badam milk and lassi centre,Vv puram food street? Rs 60Taste:5/5"
5,good guy
5,The best place for lassi and the taste is fabulous.. mouth watering taste and donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât feel like leaving that place. I recommend everyone to go and try.
1,worsted
4,Good luck
3,rabdi is good n tasty but the fruit custard is sour in taste I don't think so it's fresh
3,"This used to be a good place before. They've become famous and now the quality of the food is getting lower day by day, but the prices are rising. Cool kulfis and rabdi but a bit costly. Neither too good, nor too bad."
1,tried rose milk and badam milk. dont taste anything like their names. bad choice to go here.badam milk tasted like mediocre rasmalai milk. no hint of badam in it. rose milk is just sordid pink colored milk nothing like rose. excessively sweet.awful experience after such delicious food in food street.
4,"This small sweet shop in the famous Food street of VVPuram serves quality milk based sweets.This eatery shop like the most around there does not provide a seating area. But this cannot stop the devoted customers to come as they don't have any qualms about this factor.This eating place offers a wide variety of milk based sweets like Faloodas, Kulfis , Rabdi , Rose Milk, Badam Milk,etc.I ordered here Rabdi-Jalebi , Rose Milk and Rasmalai.Every item tasted heavenly and was soul satisfying. Also each one of them was perfectly prepared without compromising on the quality.Most important thing to mention is that the owner is serious about hygiene, quality and customer satisfaction. I am surely gonna come back here :-)Lastly I would like to conclude by requesting all the foodies out there not to compare this sweet shop with those serving the same in their authentic form."
3.5,"Had chocolate mint at night, small place but great taste. Tried the dark chocolate as well. But chocolate mint remains the favourite. Can visit the place if going for a night walk nearby ."
4.5,"Mumbai badam milk and lassi Center: Famous for milk delicacies, this 20 years old shop still continues to win the heart of all the foodies.This famous shop in VV puram serves you various milk delicacies at reasonable prices.Badam milk: This droolworthy milk with a creamy texture and nutty taste is all what you need to made your day bright?Pheni: This delicious sutarfeni served with hot almond milk and topped with finely chopped with Almonds and pistachio was what you would love to have it again and again.Rating:Ambience: This shop doesnot have seating arrangementService: 4/5Taste:4.5/5Value for money:5/5"
3,Food was fine but was not properly packed and they took a time more than normal for accepting the order. The rest was fine only the packaging and accepting order needs to be improved.
1,its a worst food and packaging
3,"Today I order dal fry, but it was like sambar, seriously too worst, and lassi was like water, but roti and Paratha was too good, it's worth following, but sometimes they did mistake like this, so please am suggesting to owner look into this, this will bad opinion to the customers on the Restaurant, I ordered here Lote of time, everytime it's too good, but I got like this first time tooooo worst. ."

5,Paneer Kadai was very tasty.
1,Ordered food online from this restaurant. Food is average and also they delivered my order with a wrong item. Ordered for a 'mushroom masala' but i received 'Dhal fry' which i dont eat.
1,One of the worst food and had to throw to the dustbin horrible abd rotten food
5,This is the small place but with very good service we are been their for Many number of times this is one of the best place to eat biriyani and now they have introduced mutton biriyani meal and chicken biriyani meal with is fill with fully moth watering biriyani kabab and many more .
2,"One of the worst Donne biryani ever I had, quantity as usual, taste feels like some normal rice with boiled chicken,the pieces very small and less amount,the gravy not good, over all for 110 rs definitely not recommended"
4,A very nice place for board game lovers. I can recollect my childhood there. There are various games and comfortable seating and they have variety of food. Tried their Maggi and Paneer Starters...It was nice... One can opt this place for relaxation and good food!
3,One who want to spend time by playing with friends or dear ones do visit this place located in Basavngudi!!?Quite nice place to play with lot and lot kind of Indore games by paying and having!!?Some offer available there for price I don't remember exactly what it is!!?Seating is bit uncomfortable and food is also okay type!! Other than that types of games they provided or service is really good!!?Best place to refresh and chill!!Overall 3.5/5 ?
2,"Not worth your money or time. It is the first floor of a house converted into a cafe. Air conditioning did not work when we had gone, and they refused to open the windows for some reason. Menu is decent, but quality of food was below average. The white pasta was pretty bad, we couldn't finish it. Maggi was okay. They charge 100rs for an hour. I'd suggest you to get your own games and sit at home and chill with some friends."
3,Looks like fast food.. No chairs to sit(very small shop).. but the food tastes really amazing.. briyani and non veg items are like home made..
3,food was good delivery is too late
5,"Good taste and Good staff......Very soft grill chicken and nice porattas, briyani rice and all variety of  chicken and mutton recipes are good....."
3.5,Quiet small place... But food here is tasty and very cheap... They have a chicken combo thali which is must try.....ambiance 2.5/5 (no seating available ... Although their are tables where you can stand and eat) .. Food 4/5 ... Staff over the place is very polite
3.5,This is quiet new outlet (small outlet) opened in the vicinity of KIMS and dead end to devegowda single road of Banashankari area. The taste and quantity is good enough to try once.The facility must be given more like sitting options or concentration on the menu items with less options need to improve on this specifications.
1,"How can I be polite? Wrong food item got delivered, I had ordered for kalmi kabab masalaAlso the taste sucks what else am I to describe about the food?"
5,Super good ambience. Good food. People can visit along with family. Good hospitality. Super place to have something special at weekend. Cool

4,"A typical Naati style restaurant with a simple ambience and a limited menu, though there are 4 to 5 pork dishes. Most of the pork dishes were quite good, the pork fry, pepper dry and chilli being the standouts and the portions were sufficient for two people. Nothing at all for vegetarians though they will whip up a good egg burji or egg masala. They have a bring-your-own booze policy, even though they don't have a licence to serve liquor, so everything works just fine! Overall, a good middle class, eat-n-drink after a long day, place!"
4.5,"Good and decent place for pork lovers located in Mysore Road - just opposite Gopalan mall. Rates are pocket friendly, ambience is decent as per the locality. Food taste is perfect coorgi touch - pork fry and Akki roti. Staff are very polite and available. Will soon add pics of yummy food . Overall good place for money. Rating 4.5"
5,"Yes that's a 5 on 5. Because i am from the north east and we are totally crazy about pork. And it's been over a month in this new place without my favorite comfort food, until i tried their Coorg Style Fried Pork. And i absolutely love it. Thank you guys for saving me with this amazing food!!! :)"
5,"Awesome Place For Pork Lovers...!!Decent Ambience...!!Authentic Coorg Pork Fry With Akki Rotti..?Pork Chilli, Pepper Dry Must Try......."
5,Great place. Can go for a change.... Outdoor seatings..make your own pizza...worth the price. BBQ is heaven here....I loved it... Must try Amruth Govindas
1,"Very poor delivery service, pizza base was on one side and the topping was on another side. Delivery reached 30 mins late and to be frank waste of money..."
1,worst pizza I ever had in my life
3,"Tried Masala Madness Pizza here and it was so delicious. The Pizzas are fresh and they are serve hot. We also tried all their BBQ's and it was not at all good. It was bland and not cooked well.Wish the ambience was much better and they used better interiors and furnitures. This place begs for an attractive ambience.Overall, good pizza but poor ambience.Pricing is overrated. Good service but very very slow.epicuresdelight.blogspot.com"
1,Base was veryyy thin. None of my frnds like it ?
1,"Hygiene is a concern. Though not intentional got the scare of my life when I saw owner lady and her assistant fix the Dustbin and compress it's content, next was to go and start touching the dough for pizza without sanitizing or washing hands. Bad part is they are not equipped. Using manual balloon air filler for barbeque fire starter. one wind is enough to make your food dusty both while eating and during preparing."
1,They don't know how to make pizza. Pizza sauce was watery. So pizza was soggy. It was half cooked. Expensive for the price we paid. Worst food.
1,pizza sucked ass
1,"All I got was a half cooked base and the toppings and cheese was no where to be found, never ordering from here and not recommending to others as well. I just wasted 200 for a half cooked base"
4,"Very good open place...loved the chocolate shake and magic mushroom...??very friendly staff...every one must try the non veg and veg starters if u visit....taste rocks????? serves you with smile which makes u happy,?"
5,Wow..Superb pizzas and barbecues.. By far one of the bests in Banashankari..Pizzas felt so fresh..It will be much better if desserts are also included in the menu.. Good stuff guys??
5,Place that stole my heart away! Pizza here is heaven!! must must try! Visiting here again really soon!??????????Ambiance is decent enough with a very cute sitting. Overall amazing everything.
1,Food not good
1,The pizza was not good... And it got stuck with the box...
5,very nice n good taste best place to hang out with friends
4,If u r a pizza n barbeque lover then this place is for u.They cook their food with a lot of love n enthusiasm so it shows.The toppings were sufficient n so t pizza seemed to hve life unlike t other pizza chains.really hot n fresh pizzas which I nvr get to eat in t usual run of t mill places...Best part is they r clean as they use biodegradable plates which isnt t case with other food trucks...thumbs up from me to tis place
3,"Good place I liked the place, friendly, taste average,Only pizza and BBQÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs are available I suggest for soft drinks also and milkshakesHot and spicy pizza is good i love the toppingOverall good place to have pizza"
5,"Pizza! The one delicious food that everyone on Earth are simply mesmerised by. What could be greater than a super hot, loaded with extra cheese and toppings pizza from As on Fire? At As on Fire, you are never going to miss one of the best thin crust pizzas. Baked evenly in a woodfire oven, it is so appetizing by its looks. One bite and you're drawn into heaven. Its making is done in a truck and this makes it the most unique pizza and a 'must try'. The taste is well enhanced by the fresh cheese used and what makes the pizza more toothsome are the fresh toppings in the best combinations. You're guaranteed to taste assorted pizzas here. This place is more of a foodies hub than anything else and it doesn't stop itself from attracting those non-foodies."
4,Awesome place with good ambiance and great taste but going there at night s better than day times. The pizzaÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs taste is really nice with thin crust. The prices are also pretty reasonable.
3.5,It's basically a woodfired pizza and BBQ shop. I am impressed with how on minimal budget they have decorated the place. I tasted the masala madness pizza.it was spicy and good in taste. They currently have only non veg BBQs so couldn't taste that. The only negative is that their service is slow. You have to wait a lot to get your pizza.
3.5,"For a new restaurant, this place has a long way regarding ambience, but makes it up for the taste and quality of food. For the fresh one in the block, it's turning out to be quite the competitor, Chicken Drumsticks were just lip smacking. Definitely recommendable to friends and family.Authentic Barbeque food."
3.5,Nice cute outlet fab concept nice food but a big over priced for the quantity servedCan get better if revise pricesEven menu is very limitedSuggest to increase a little more Italian stuff Subhadeep DasAltogether a 7/10 ...
3.5,"A newly opened place but simple and done in a very different concept.With no plans we ended up here at their closing time, yet the crew welcomed with a happy smile. we ordered for the chicken wings and BBQ pizza so that we are safe and know what would be served, but to our happiness both were so tasty.PIzza was so well done with the amazing amount of toppings, I have had enough chicken pizza around but no one adds so much chicken pieces as these people do. they had enough toppings added to keep me happy.A little grooming is definitely required but lovely place to be around with frnds.All the best team!!"
4.5,Wood fire pizza in a food truck is something interesting! They serve very delicious thin crust pizza. I give 5/5 for the taste. Ambiance can be improved and I have given 4.5 just because they don't serve drinking water for the customers. A must try place.
4.5,Good location.Pizzas taste great.Full points for taste.Can improve the ambience a little.Good experience.The only drawback is it becomes difficult if its raining.
1,I was very happy with the service and the quality and the taste of the food till I asked for a glass of water and everyone were blinking at me. The lady who was handling the cash counter mentioned that they sell only bottled water and they don't have normal drinking water. This to me sounds either atrocious or completely forgotten in hindsight. What kind of establishment can you run if you can't even give normal drinking water to your customers? Fix this up first.
5,RATED Quality food served. Ambience is pretty amazing nd the owners r like the coolest people u'll meet which makes ur experience a whole lot exciting...must visit restaurent.!!
3.5,"This place serves pretty good wood fire pizza.... Tangy and fiery... With the perfect amount of zing for your taste buds. The pizza n BBQ might put your pocket a little on fire, but it's worth that tiny fire strike.The ambience is pretty decent...good music..and very interesting seating."
4,"One of the best dishes IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâve had here is ...squid ghee roastFood is resonable ,tasty and worth for what you are payingTry out the boiled rice ,which you donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât get everywhere"

5,"Curry leaves is an multicuisine restaurant specializing in chinese, mangalorean, and Indian cuisine.The ambience is a huge space consisting of two floors . The first floor being the fine dine and the second being the bar.The place is mostly crowded on weekends.Some of the recommendations here are1) anjal masala fry: fresh fish and yummy masala.2) prawn ghee roast: super amazing, highly recommended!! However the vegetarian version made with mushrooms is equally awesome.3) prawn ghassi with kori roti: yummy and healthy option4) chicken malai tikka: done right5) crispy corn : classic bar bite paired well with my pint of beer.In desserts the gulab jamun was done nicely.The service is quick and prompt and the waiters are always eager to please."
5,"Multicuisine fine dine restaurant in Bangalore!Curry leaves is a multicuisine restaurant located near yediyur lake in Jayanagar.The ambience is spread over two floors with the first being a family dine in and the second floor being a bar .However drinks are served on the first floor as well.The ambience resembles a family fine dine space flanked with comfortable sofas tables and curtains.The food here consists of Indian tandoor and Chinese variants along with some classic cocktails.I would highly recommend the seafood specialities here as its is tasty as well as reasonably priced.1) prawn ghee roast (must try)2) anjal tawa fry3) Mangalore style prawn ghassi with neer dosa4) malai chicken tikka5) crispy cornAll of the above dishes are highly recommended out here , the mushroom ghee roast is an great vegetarian alternative for the same.In desserts the gulab jamun and gudbad is worth a try.The service is prompt and nice."
4,"I visited this restaurant for a Sunday night dinner and it was occupied by mostly families in no time. It's an Andhra cuisine restaurant so would be an apt choice for people who love spicy food.In the starters, I loved the rich Prawn ghee roast.The mains consisted of Makai palak which was sweet corn and spinach curry, NILGIRI MURGH and a mildly flavoured Mangalorean dish, Prawn Gassi curry along with neer dosa.I also tried the crispy kora roti,which is made of rice and a speciality of Mangalore, with chicken curry.We ended the meal with gulab jamun and Gadbad in desserts.missfoodaficionado.wordpress.com"
4,"Its a nice place with convenient parking. Suited for a casual dinner with friends or family. The pricing is placed very correctly. For the kind of food quality and service they provide the pricing point of around 1200/- for 2 is absolutely fine.In the starters the mushroom ghee roast, khafila roast chicken and prawns ghee roast tops my list. They go very well with any cocktail. I specially liked the Pina Colada and Long Island Ice Tea. In the main course Deewani Handi, Nilgiri Murgh and Mutton Chop Masala are the must try!The meal ended with a very enjoyable brownie and Gadbad (ice cream sundae). I will recommend a visit to try the delicacies and the place has all the right things to easily become a regular hang-out place."
4,"I visited this restaurant for a Sunday night dinner and it was full in an hour. It's an Andhra cuisine restaurant so a culinary delight for people who love spicy food.I like the daiquiri in cocktails.In the starters, I liked Crispy corn, MUSHROOM GHEE ROAST, KHAFILA CHICKEN TIKKA andFRIED CHICKEN KABAB. The ghee roast was spicy but delicious.The mains consisted of Makai palak which was corn and spinach curry, NILGIRI MURGH and a mildly flavoured PRAWNS GASSI along with my dosa.I also tried something new, kora roti,which is made of rice and a speciality of Mangalore, with chicken curry. Crispy roti went well with the curry.In desserts I liked the gadbad which was an ice cream with fruits and the gulab jamun."
4,"Well, as far as I know Curry Leaves is one such restaurant which serves Andhra Thali at very nominal price. Believe me, itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs as good as other expensive places with respect to quality and consistency. I had been here a couple of days before for dinner and decided to try some Coastal Food. I started with Mushroom Chilli, it was very well done with strong flavours and it was made exactly like the way I want. Mushroom Ghee Roast wasnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât so authentic. However, I would certainly go back for it and the pricing is certainly competitive. Interiors are decent, I mean you can take your family without second thought. Neer Dose and Veg Curry was just okayish. Probably, one can skip this dish. Their GudBud is simply awesome. Folks are attentive and knowledgeable.bangaloreepicure.com"

3,Its Called as Nellore Andhra cuisine but its a multi cuisine is what I understood when I  went through the menu..!!So i tried to order some North Indian Dishes and they didn't really disappoint me..!!I liked their Crispy corn and Paneer Kebab ..!!Loved their Methi Malai Mutter - Very different and tasty..!!I Chose Wine for Mocktails..!!Loved their GadBad and Brwnie..!!Overall Its a decent Experience..!!Would come again for their Nellore Andhra Meals..!!#SakhiRavoorDiariessakhiravoor.wordpress.com
5,"This is a Multi-Cuisine restaurant that serves delicious food with love. The Prawns Ghee Roast is one of the tastiest Ghee Roast variants in a long time. Starters here are quite good, so are the main course dishes and desserts.The vegetarian options are equally good here.The Gudbud ice cream, famous in Mangalore, is made quite well here too.foodnwine.in"
3,"First order was home delivery, took 15 min to deliver so ice cream was 80% melted (was expected).First impression portion size was good in the price. Now come the main thing i.e. taste. We ave ordered Falooda and fruits with ice cream. Falooda taste was decent, it came with vanilla ice cream, rose syrup, falooda & chia seeds. Well original falooda is made with kulfi and that is rare to find in Bangalore.Fruits with ice cream was ok, as ice cream was melted it was like custard. Fruit variety was not there, majority was banana.I would suggest to bring variety in fruits. Overall it was ok experience."

3,"Kind service is given here, though it does not have great ice creams you can go here just to have ice cream and a good time with friends and colleagues. Priced moderate."
3,Ambience - small and neat With 6 - 8tables..Staff - friendlyPrice - value for moneyFood - we had ordered for :Green apple and some blue slush both were pretty good...Fries tasted good but t disappointing factor was they don't sever it t way they had described bout it.. The menu said cheese fries filled with jalapeno sauce blaa blaa but wat they served was normal fries with mayo sauce..Babycorn Manchurian sandwich was one of t different kinds tat I tasted and wud recommend tat...Keema wrap tasted good...Fruit basket sundae was yummy.. Must try as they put all the different kinds of natural flavor of ice creams (which is highlight) filled with lots of yummy fruits...

4,"This place offers great taste and amazing presentation icecreams, it's a good hangout place as well.if u visit bangalore and does't eat icecream from this parlour, then you haven't enjoyed anythings here."
5,Best natural ice cream I have tasted. Baby corn Sandwich was just awesome ?? it was a my surprise birthday treat from my friends. Loved the place n the options of their food. One should try the natural scoop they have! Good place to visit.
5,"Mouth-watering and delectable ice creams are served here. It's always a different feeling of having natural ice cream in here. Had jackfruit natural and it was awesome?. You can't restrict yourself by trying all their other options like Baby corn manchurian sandwich, crunchy cold koffee thickshake and tender coconut scoop??. Great place to visit with friends and spend some quality time in peace. Must try this place!!"
5,Good place for having ice creams & shakes. Different tasty varieties.. I loved jackfruit thick shake & natural tender coconut ice cream.. it's damn good. Place is small but ambiance is good. Nice place to hangout with friends.
4.5,"Nice ambiance, thick shake is good( should try jack fruit thick shake).Kheema sandwich is awesome.The real fruit pulp shake and ice creams are best here.Thanks tamarino."
4.5,"Nice place we ordered fries, kheema sandwich and thick shakes, taste is really good and the employees are really good, calm ambience to be with your family and friends.

4.5,Best ever ice cream.... 1st time in life having natural ice cream.... Especially jackfruite items like milkshake and ice-cream the only one in Bangalore.... Yumyyyy!!!Everyone must try... Good atmosphere for family too...
2,"Not recommended for anyone who's planning to try this place.We bought chocolate ice cream, tandoori paneer wrap, green apple slush and french fries and none of it were good. The ice cream was really bad, not worth so much at all , green apple slush was like cough syrup, the fries and wrap were comparatively okay.Service 4/5Ambience 2.75/5Food 2/5But what's a place with no good food."
3.5,"If you're looking for a quick-byte and a place to spend good time with your folks, this is the place you could consider going. Though the dishes were a little over priced, they were deleicious. The Baby Corn Manchurian Sandwich was really yummy and is a must try. The ambiance is quite small and not so spacious. One should be very cautious of the staircase, else they might hurt their head. This apart, the staff were friendly."
4,"Visited this placed based on Zomato reviews.. Ambience decent..Ordered tomato shorba which was awesome, some cheese veggie rolls coated with some greens which was decent.. Jeera rice with papad gravy which was sooperb thou the quantity of gravy was very less, we asked for more and the waiter politely got some more.. surprise element was a complimentary palak halwa which was simply out of this world..yumm..perfect..just perfect!"
1,"I ordered a sizzling noodle without onions and garlic from Desi cream junction ....but the restaurant sent it with onions and garlic ... They asked me to reorder, but I was not able to do so..My complain was not undertaken... This was my last order with zomato again.I am not going to order again."

1,"Really disappointed with Desi Cream Junction, Very poor and slow service, No value for money, food taste really bad. I am not going to visit next time."
5,Awesome food and Bollywood names make the place memorable. Being pure veg added a feather or two to their hackle. Great experience. Would love to visit them as often as possible.
5,"We were at family party last weekend at Jayanagar Agarwal bhavan 1st floor, it was simply awesome. Intiatly we thought it would be like normal Resturent, but we soon realise the taste, ambiance, the service simply superb. If your foody kind I would definitely recommend this place. I love it.."

4.5,Good taste and super service... Nice place to Hangover with Family... We had a get to gether party around 25 people... They given good menu and served best...
5,"This restaurant situated above Bangalore Agarwal Bhavan in Jayanagar is under rated. My wife and myself went there on a monday night for dinner. Ordered ""Tu cheese badi hai mast mast"" starter, Veg Manchow soup, ""desi garlic bread"" and Veg bhartha. The starter was unique and presented in a very attractive way. Spinach leaves were stuffed with potato and cheese and deep fried. They were presented in little pressure cookers. The desi garlic bread was awesome with lots of garlic pieces and butter. Veg bhartha had a nice texture and smoky flavour and came with a nice presentation of papad, cubed cucumber and carrots neatly placed in a porcelain jar. It also came with a naan which they told was part of the presentation. Finally got palak halwa as a complimentary dessert and it was good. Service was good and swift and the waiters served with a smile even when it was almost closing time. Definitely going to take my parents next time for lunch or dinner."
4,"Had party of 20 members with family friends last night.... They suggested to go for fixed menu with unlimited food. starting form soup end with dessert. they had given us for private dine in area, where we all have enjoyed a lot, done masti with family members and children...out of all food, the rice item was little roasted...and was not happy with that... complain to the manager on the same... he apologized and said that, it will not be repeated again...The staffs are good, service is good....Let us try once again...."

5,Awesome bottle!!!
5,tastes natural..bit overpriced
5,yummmy
4,Service is too good here and also I like smoothie here......And my personal favourite is kiwi and nutty shake..................................
4,.The french fries were soft instead of crunchy even the small ones.
2,the bottle was not full.
1,Taste was like cough syrup. Drake the sane shake from different drunken money it was great buy this place was total crap.
1,the juice was worst
4,yummy pure Nutella shake
1,There was no icecream in that shake of yours and fires didn't had any kind of cheese and they were not even crisp some cold potatoes with bitter taste yuck
5,Just love this place. And excellent smoothies Amazing staff. Really hippie atmosphere along with the wacky drinks make it a must visit.???
5,one of the tastiest shakes I have ever had
5,the drink was truely awesome?totally satisfied!
1,"HereÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs why you get 1 star. You accept an order, make the customer wait 30 minutes, then decline order. Way to go guys!! Wish there was 0 star rating!"
5,"On  23-4-19 my friends and i have been here and we enjoyed singing,playing in a  corner we all enjoyed here :) and it is a special placeand there i saw a cycle and asked them that why cycle has no brakes so they told ""this cycle doesn't have brakes as life doesn't have brake:)""and there are more than 25 types of smoothies i have tasted 3 of them.coffee browni.nutcase..almond chocolatethank's a lot for making us happy:)"
4.5,Been here ..Very nice place to hangout and the owner was friendly . He explained me all the types of drinks available. In order the nutshell and felt very tasty and natural.
3,Coffee taste was not great
5,"Drunkey Money is always special.Anyone who likes fruits, will definitely like it.Have tried around 10-12 different smoothies so far.All of em, were rich in fruit flavor and tasted amazing.Thumbs up to the friendly owner as well, whoÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs very helpful in selecting the right drink.Do give it a visit.."
5,Tasted nutcase smoothie for the first time and it was so yumm... place is so nice to sit and relax with some nice music And games ... I would want to try sandwiches next time ?
4,Had a quick visit there to have a healthy shake.. their all fiber shake which turned out to be good. Also had the red velvet shake which seemed more like a strawberry shake than a red velvet shake. But enjoyed it none the less. And then a spinach corn sandwich which was good too. Over-all had a fun time playing Jenga while finishing our snack and smoothies. Good staff very chatty chap.
5,Great variety of shakes. Good service! Nice food. A great place for students to hang out and snacking? Nice ambience! Student discount also available!
5,"Very nice place! Delicious drinks with great Ambience... Tried my all time favourite of Drunken Monkey ""Nut Case"" and its awesome as usual. They provide 10% discount for students if they carry their school/college id(none of the drunken monkey stores have this offer). Parents can take their kid along with their school/college id and claim the discount :) Staff is very co-operative and will guide you to choose the right drink based on your mood or health/fruit/vegetable/energy or choice. If Madhusudhan is around, he will give you enough information and history about Drunken Monkey and help you find your right drink. If you stay somewhere nearer to Kumaraswamy layout, don't miss enjoying a delicious drink here. You can take away the drink along with the cute DM signature glass bottle if you wish to."
4.5,Had been here for the first time had a good experience..milkshake was thick and good.. Waiting to try rest of the milkshakes.. There are board games to play inside.. Staffs are friendly.
5,Great to be here 1st store at Kumaraswamy Layout enjoyed a lot kind and helpful staff great games to hang on with tasty smoothies love this place ?
1,This place serves one of the most horrible food in the townHappened to order gobi manchurian which reached me after 70 minsOn seeing the quantity itself I was irritatedWhen I opened the box believe it or not the food tasted so bad and had some horrible smell that I had to throw away the foodJust a couple of pieces actually upset my stomach enough to keep me up all nightPlease do not order from hereI've reviewed nearly 70+ restaurants till date but never have I ever been so angry in my life.Worst experience ever
3,Definitely something which is pocket friendly. The quantity is good as well. Quality of the food is above average. Their Kheema paratha is great! Biryani is quite filling but just okay in taste. One Chicken Tikka roll is sufficient to fill you up. Ambiance is decent.
2,"One of my friend referred this place for me so we went all away from Jayanagar to banashankari.Finally we reached Gundu pulav , nothing much to say about ambience , went and ordered chicken biryani and it's self service place!!!!!And finally Gundu pulav is in table seriously it's not at all good so disappointing.Quality was goodRice quality was not goodPlace is quite clean"
4,"Was a good place for a good non spicy Pulav,and served well in traditional way....I like as it was flavored lightly...and complements are just right.Love to visit again."
5,A very old legendary and famous pulav Specialist they are. You can have this anytime and everytime. It's good to see them giving franchise to almost every one and most of them are youngsters. The pulav tastes amazing... You need to add the pepper salt they provide to chicken or mutton pulav. This increases the taste of it. In the recent days they have introduced few new dishes/starters... Fish kabab out them is the amazing one. I recommend all the dishes here.
3,"Good taste, not so favourite to overhype though. Had hazel nut shake, quantity is too less for the price they charge. No seating available. You can take the bottle for youself ?"
3.5,"Visited this restaurant recently . The restaurant is located in yarab Nagar near monotype - BNM college junction ,quite visible from the main road .Coming to food I ordered a plate of parotha and it was quite good , the parotha was freshly made and hot I wish it was roasted just a little more but it was good enough . You get 2 parotha in one plate the size of it is also quite adequate . You get chutney and saguu with it . The chutney is quite normal the saguu was good ,it was filled with veggies and right amount of spice .They had filter coffee and a young kid was making it , so the coffee decoction to milk ratio was a little of but you can tell him how of it you want and he'll put that much .The place is quite small and can seat about 10 people and another 10 can stand and eat with tables So not much of an ambeince .The place is clean though .The prices are quite nominal the price one plate parotha was 30 bucks .Overall a pretty good old styled darshini ."
1,Stael fud. No taste in food at all.......Ned to chek kwality b4 serving. ......Menus opshions are very very less ...Kwality can't be comprimosed for food...
1,For a store that's placed right in the middle of a Polluted Road - I cannot how someone can guarantee the Quality and Edibility of its food.Sev-Puri and other chaats are priced at twice the normal rates even when the only place to sit and stand is on the Footpath.The taste of the food doesn't make up for these shortcomings either.Much better options are just a furlong away
4,"A hole in d wall kinda outlet just before Gandhi Bazar. There's just place to sit for two people, otherwise stand out n eat. He makes d food fresh right in front of u. We had Tawa Pulao and Pav Bhaji. Both tasted good. Generous helpings of raita with d Pulao. Prices are pocket friendly. Nice place to eat tasty food without feeling d pinch?"
2,Food is good but pricing wise itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs very costly also the food quantity is decent enough but not appropriate to the amount they are charging..
4.5,"A small place near North road flyover , hygenic food affordable rates and extremely tasty , mouth-watering snacks ! Definitely worth visiting more than once"
1,"The first time I ordered from here I was really happy. But after that it was downhill.I ordered the shawarma plate a bunch of times and recently I ordered the jumbo version twice but I got even lesser chicken than the normal quantity both times. The kubbos becomes hard by the time itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs delivered and of late, IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâm getting more veggies and less meat and today when I ordered the SI Special shawarma plate, I got no fries AT ALL! ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs there in the menu but not on my plate. Maybe it was a blessing because the fries are soggy by the time it reaches here and IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâve noticed a lot of people complaining similarly. Sad place.They take advantage of the fact that because itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs delivery, you canÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât return it. If you want shawarma, this is not the place to order from."
1,Not a good place to hangout food is not good chocolate milkshake is like chocolate water save your money there are many other good cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå©s on the surrounding
4,The theme of the place is good and nice but not so amazing..the food is ok ok ..the hookahs is fine ...the place is kind of hot ..because of no fan or a/c
1,Worst Pasta....I ordered white sauce pasta instead I got red sauce pasta...that too with rancid taste...will never order from this restaurant again
1,I had ordered both veg and non veg pasta with white sauce and it wasn't up to the mark. There were no spice or flavours added to it plus it was so dry. Not gonna order anymore from here.
3,"The place is very close to DSCE and yet I hadnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât visited it for a while.Finally got an opportunity. The place is quite expensive and neither the quality or quantity of food is good enough for the money.The ambience is unique but still not maintained very well. Loud music, floor seating, seesha and lights is something different that this place offers you.Good for match screenings and hangout with friends.But if youÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâre going just for the food. You might be disappointed."

4,"Another small joint in By-lanes of Jayanagar 4th block, they have only 2 items in their menu, the famous Madurai Jigarthanda, with and without ice-cream.  By the look of the place, we can observe that they do not prepare the jigarthanda there, when enquired they said they get supply from SS Dairy foods, which has made a very good name in Madurai jigarthanda shops in Madurai. Taste is good, one can have this after a good meal, very soothing."
3,the item was not chilling instead warm
1,"Quantity is very very very less, I wish to post a picture which I am not sure how to do."
4,"This is my destination on the morning and evening walk so became my breakfast & dinner place quite often during my  going on days in Basavanagudi the cultural heart of city. I tasted here Rava Idly, Khara bath, Bonda soup, tea, raagi malt. Everything was extremely good in taste. more than expectation."
1,Kind of order I have received. Uncooked and looked as if dough was days old which was used to make chapatis. It was kind pf rotten smell coming from these
1,I have ordered boneless curry. And I ended up at a with bone curry and ended up throwing it away. I have sent photos as proof to zomato chat support as required it. So much for waiting for an hour only to discover food which I hadnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât ordered

1,"ordered paratha and pickle combo, didn't get picked and curd was spoiled .,there is not even a single piece of paneer in paneer Patiala ( chef might have forgot to add paneer in gravy).,very bad experience , never ever order food from this' Funjabi curries ' . day started with very bad food"
4,"This is a no-frills place in NR colony that serves yummy South Indian lunch at affordable prices. Hygienic, healthy and total VFM.Must have: Sweet Pongal, Rice-Majjigehuli, Puliyogare and Masala MajjigeThe place is open only for lunch (between 11:30 am and 3 pm or until the food lasts) and is a hit among the professors/teaching staff from the nearby APS college and people who would want to take away food (note that you will have to carry your own boxes to take away food from here)My rating of this place:Taste: 5/5Ambience: 3/5Hygiene: 5/5VFM: 5/5Speed of Service: 5/5Overall: 4.6/5 (excellent)"
2,"Heard a lot about this restaurant and the food. With expectation had been to this place on last Saturday at around 2:00 PM. Place was Crowded , decent and especially more for take-way. We have to collect tokens and go further inside to collect food. Yes its a self-service and few chairs are available to seat. We ordered Puliogare, chapatti with bhindi curry and sakkarai pongal.Puligare was some what balanced in spices and ok in taste. But bhindi curry and chapatti are very disappointing, too much of sweetness into curry and totally not good. Even we felt high sweet in sakkarai pongal. Even the people who serve food have lot of attitude issues while serving food.Food price is nominal and pocket friendly.Overall: 2/5Ambiance: 2.5/5- No dedicated seating arrangements, Few round stools are available for seating.Food: 2/5Service: 2/5Price: 3.5/5Enjoy your food and make sure food is not wasted.sandeepkasal.wordpress.com"
5,"I tried puliyogare and ambode. And I like the puliyogare but ambode was a little cold, one of the best authentic Iyengar hotels in Basavanagudi, price is very cheap but the quality is good"
4,"This place is unique for there authentic Brahmin food and taste! Service at this place is quick, staff is friendly and handle customers really well! Menu is pocket friendly looks simple. It is really hygienic, tasty and healthy ? must visit place around NR colony(near to Mahila mandali school)One suggestion would be - opening the restaurant around 9 clock would be good and ideal!"
4,"Just simple and Tasty !! Please do visit this place, if you love to have homemade,Bramhin/Iyengari style taste and food.I feel they planned the place very well, in front of there own house,correct me if i am wrong!! It is very close to NR Colony BusStop. I didnot have food in this place, but a take away, First things first,Loved ther paintings. Prices start from 5rs to 30rs, Yes you read it correctly. Visit the place to witness the same.I took, Puliogare and Ambvode, it was packed well. I stay 10 minutes away from this place, once i reached home and unpacked the food, it was still fresh. Coming to the taste, Puliogare was spicy,tangy and good to taste. Ambvode was not hard, but good to taste, it was fried in oil, but it was not too oily. I would love to taste there Sweet pongal and khara pongal.PS: You can carry your boxes from home to pack foodsridhar1206.blogspot.com"
5,This place is as authentic as it can be. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs also very hygienic. The staff are friendly and welcoming.Must try EVERYTHING ON THE MENU. ( trust me itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs worth it)The dishes are very reasonably priced with no compromise on the serving portions.Thanks to the restaurant to keep the authenticity and tradition of local cuisine alive.
3,"Okay-ish ...they have good variety on the menu, also comes at affordable prices. This outlet is small yet peaceful because of its location. Homely food.No filter coffee available."
4,"Is a small place but has very attractive paintings on wall the food tastes very good , it feel like homemade food must try out food was PuliyogareV get only few number of foods in the menu but with very good taste it as varieties of food like ambode sakare Pongal , Kara Pongal and nowadays they have introduced chapathis also , Maintains was very good and in polite way"
5,The finger food is great and the yellow lit ambience is very calming. The rooftop according to me is the best place to dine in. The service is pretty fast with reasonable portions.
3,I had been been to Salut on a Saturday night with a friend. The place was packed with only fee tables unoccupied.I checked out all the floors and found the rooftop as the best place to settle in.Salut is one of the best options available around to chill. It's located near Jayanagar 4th block and is spread across three floors.Salut offers a variety of food and beverages but lack options for vegetarians.We ordered few beers along with peri peri french fries and pizza.The pizza could have been a lot better.Recommended for its ambience. Will add more shortly.Cheers!
4,"Had been there to have quick bites with some beer. The ambience is nice with well lit yellow lights. The service is these best part . Also this place is attached to a mangalorean style restaurant, hence the menu is predominantly based on Mangalore cuisine. They have very limited number of starters. Pizzas are great though . And post 7.30 they have an in house dj who plays good music."
4,Was really impressed with the ambiance. They have a large display screen and the vertical garden concept is very good. Food is great. Drinks are little over priced. Try out this place if youÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâre in and around south Bangalore.
5,"We celebrated my friendÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs birthday here and it was really fun.My order-Starters-1. French fries-Crispy fries and tasty dips. IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâd rate it 10/10.Mains-1. Veggie Bell pepper Pizza-I was very impressed with the size of the pizza. It had a thin crust and everything was cooked very well. They couldÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâve added more vegetables, but it was still a good dish. IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâd rate it 9/10.2. Penne Alfredo-Delicious. Both the pasta and sauce were cooked to perfection. Again, the quantity was worth the price. Definitely give this dish a try.Drinks-Virgin Mojito and Kingfisher Beer Tower-I liked them both. Former was refreshing and latter was good.Overall, We all had a nice time at Salut. The Pricing is on the average side and the staff is very friendly too."
4,My first experience wasn't great with regular fish lunch menuThis is my secondGood ambiance @ PubHighly tasty prawn pudina ghee roastCaribbean chicken riceKeep up..
4,Ambience 9/10Food 8/10Drinks 8/10Service 8/10Salut means hi in French but also is a term used while drinking similar to cheers. This restaurant embodies the word 'Salut'. The restaurant has alot of greenery which gives the whole place an outdoors and fresh vide. It feels like an escape from the city when it's in fact situated in the middle of Jayanagar. The drinks and food is really good. The pesto pizza and the wings are a perfect accompaniment for the beer and drinks. It's a great place for a night out or just for a lazy Sunday. Thier brownie is also delicious.I rate this restaurant a 8/10.
4,1st what I liked about this restaurant is their ambience and itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a rooftop restaurant.Tried the cocktails daiquiri and Long Island ice tea both were perfect to taste.Had the corn cheese bites which was yummy too served with mayonnaise dip.And at last had the pesto pizza which was good with lots of veggies. Although the slices were very thin we couldnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât finish it fully.Would love to drop in again and try out the other items on the menu.
1,"SO LOUD.There's not even a dancefloor, but the DJ plays loud, obnoxious music in the dining area. It's so loud, one can't even hear the people at the same table. The place is also uncomfortably small to be so loud. We requested the staff to have the volume lowered but they flatly refused. We couldn't even go through with placing the order."
3,"We landed up at Salut this evening at 6.30pm for a quick swig. The place is done up in the usual way of bars and pubs, bang in the middle of Jayanagar 4th block. Unfortunately, there is a lot of incoming noise of the prevalent traffic.Only one other table was occupied. We ordered a couple of beers, salted peanuts and chicken strips. They got the order wrong and got the chips instead. Once the correct order came, it was spicy... contrary to what we had requested. The chicken strips were tasty though. The service in general seemed very mediocre.All in all, it was an okay experience. Will I go there again? Maybe not. I would definitely recommend they offer better service and attention to detail for the future."
2,"Its an average place , nothing much to talk about. You can probably skip this place for the time being  and try other places which are well known."
4,Nice place to drink with friends... wouldn't go there just for the food. Ambience is great when they screen matches.Must have: Stir fried prawns
3,"As we were too early for a movie show we thought of kill some time in a pub and then came across this pub,situated in a very prime location of Jaynagar..Ambience is nice and DJ was playing some good old English classics ..For food we have ordered grilled pepper chicken which was very good taste wise..watermelon mocktail named as tarbooza was very average"
5,Was really impressed with the ambience. Food was great but the quantity is a bit less still worth it. Open balcony & mild music is great too. Fun place to have a pleasant dinner with family & friends.
4,"Ambience is great, and I like the starters most , it tastes very good , and should keep more drinks available alcohol.. itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs good to hangout there"
3,"I have hopped almost all the places in jaynagar .As I entered I was really impressed with the ambiance , they have a rooftop with a large display screen for all the sports lovers . I ordered some cocktails and they were well done but not so good.The food on the other hand was a huge disappointment ."
3,"As it is at the heart of Jayanagar, I have been waiting to visit this place. As I entered, I was really impressed with the ambience. They have a rooftop with a large display screen for all the sports lovers.I ordered a few cocktails and they were well done.The food on the other hand was a huge let down for me. I ordered pork ribs, egg ghee roast, and chicken tawa fry. The restaurant serves very less portion of food for the amount they charge. The taste is'nt so great and did not impress me much.All in all, this restaurant was just an average experience for me."
5,"Finally I found a place in place in Jayanagar with music that loud and great, which increases the buzz.. Food was great.. good Ambiance. Little pocket unfriendly but worth it..!! A Must visit place??"
3,3 is for decent food and that's it nothing good about this place.we were group of 10 people we had ordered some food and we had spent around 45 mins there and boom for our surprise the management tells us to pay the cheque and move out because the bill wasn't more than 1k. Though we had told them we would order sometime later!we didn't want to spoil the celebrations so we didn't argue much and ordered some more food and drinks which summed around 4k and later the waiter gives some cheap look as if we are eating for free. this was one of the worst restaurant I have ever been! careful you guys! everything you do matter we are in digital world act responsibly!ps: food was decentand place wasn't that great! (ambiance)
2,"taste is average , less quantity they are giving 50% off, but it's Nt enough to have, please make sure Nt give offers like this restaurants !"
3,Food is not hot n kebab has not been boiled/fried well..Biriyani rice is also not up-to the mark.Even Quantity is very poor at spent money
5,"Food is really good, very friendly staff combined with a good service. Although they've limited menu but the food is really tasty. My everyday stop for lunch."

4,This place is good for a quick bite of authentic south Indian cuisine! I personally love their idlis and millet pongal ?! The chutney is absolutely delicious! Kara bhaath is also decent!Their Chinese kitchen offers soups for 15 Rs. ! Pretty decent for the price ! The Hakka Chinese starters are equally good ! The fried rice and noodles are good !Ambience-3.5Taste-4Value for money-5Overall rating- 4
2,taste was not good
5,Awesome dosa...i personally hate dosa but once u have dosa in this cafe u will love it?. All other foods are also tasty.. Price wise excellent...
5,Great place. Spotted rhis place by chanceWas looking for parking and noticed this place.We were there for evening Tiffin and ordered different varieties of dosas. All of them were tasty.Not like darshinis were they look good but no taste. Really glad we visited this place.
5,U will get the best dosa in and around this area or may be Bangalore as well.Vada and sambar as well ????????????????????????
5,Awesome dishes ....which I really loved ???? foods are to tasty ....I would like to give 5 stars ....awesome keep it up.....the best cafe ever
4,Had Sweet Corn Schezwan Dosa and Golmaal Dosa yesterday. It was really good. Small place with great taste. Liked the twist to dosa they make. Kudos!
5,One of the best 99 variety dose shops in Bangalore. Never dissatisfied me with the varieties of dose here. Since 4 years I'm visiting this place and always love to try new variety. But I take schezwan veg roll all the time which is my favourite dish here. So yummy so tasty so delicious....
5,The name itself says it all.... variety of dosas......u can also ask for the choice of your toppings on the dosa... In simple u get a customised dosa of your choice... My all tym favourite is pizza dosa and Schezwan corn cheese dosa....???? These dosas are filled with cheeeseeeeee??
4,Great variety of dosas. They are located right next to Big bazaar in Katriguppe. Small joint with limited plastic stools to sit and enjoy the dosa. Personal favourite - Sweet corn dosa and Spring vegetable dosa.One suggestion - To get best of the taste eat the dosa hot instead of getting parcelled.
4,"Service - 4/5Taste - 4/5Cheap, great quantity, brilliant taste and a good variety in cuisine and food items. What more do you need.Perfect place to eat on a budget, or even in general. A full stomach in less than or equal to 150.10/10 recommend this place to everyone especially college students who find their mess or pg food stale, boring and monotonous."
3,"This place is located exactly behind BMS hostel, easily identifiable in the busy roads. This place is a pure vegetarian restaurant with nice ambience with lights all around. Seatings are available.Ordered 1) Harabara kabab with was crispy and tasty but the cost of it wasn't satisfactory.2) ordered Malai kofta for the Indian bread.The gravy was thick and creamy with the kofta balls which were soft.3) Ordered Plain roti and garlic naan Indian breads, was quiet good.Overall the place and food was good. The place looks good in the evening with the lights."
4,Food - 8/10Service - 7/10Ambience - 8/10Cost -8/10A good vegetarian restaurant in banashankari. The food tastes very good. Most of the time it's crowded so it becomes a bit noisy in it but the ambience and rest very good. They can make their service a quite better.
5,"An amazing place for evening snack and dinner .... they serve a unique variety of food here .... must try chats, ice cream and parathas here.... ????..... the prices are also very reasonable"
4,"Uttarahalli was really longing a good cafe to chill in the weekends. Crunch n munch seemed to have filled that void. Great place, decent Ambience, good quality food n great variety.. have tried Dahi BHEL puri, baby corn chilly and cutlet chat. All of these items were really tasty and totally worth the money"
4,This is a new outlet in uttarahalli.Specially for veg snacks.If you love mushrooms you should definitely try mushrooms pepper dry. They have gulkand pani Puri which is yumm too. Amazing presentation which tempts you to gobble all the food.Value for money too.
4,"This is a new Chats Shop in Uttarhalli.It is nice and diffrent chats, Chinese and Icecreams available.Ambience is small and nice. Cleanliness is maintained. Staff are quick.We tried bhel puri, bombay special chats and special cutlet masala. It was nice.Chinese innovative items are also good.Biriyani flavour ice-cream is avilable too.Make sure you don't miss visiting this outlet."
4,"My search for veg edible basket ended here... Its damn yummy n all the other dishes that we tried are supa dupa Gud n ambience, location too good. Value for money."
4,Its a nice place with chaats sandwiches Pastas and chinese items. Loved their soup...It matched my spice levels.Their Babycorn hot pot is a spicy dish.Nice starter and Manchurian Momos were excellent too. Very pocket Friendly. Its self service and place is neat. Would definitely visit again to explore few more dishes.If cold beverages are introduced it will be more nice.On my second visit enjoyed more delicasies like Cheese Masala Puri wonton soup Leefu momos Hot Tea American Chopusey Rolls crispy honey pepper Paneer.
4,"located near basavanagudi - ammaÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs pastries with some hidden delicacies. tried paneer chilli along with corn kernels and veg rice. every one of them was tasting pretty well.this place is perfect for college goers and friends to catch up.on the flip side, place is pretty packed all the times and tough to find a parking spot. also roads are pretty narrow. this might make this place for one to think before they choose.and regarding the pricing, it hardly burns up to 150-300 per person for trying 6 dishes ?"
4,"I visit this place regularly .best place for bf ,lunch or dinner . self service.ill straight tell u guys it is best here1)Aki idli2)rava idli3)Palav4)best pongal5)dahi Vada6) mughlai Biryani,fried rice, ManchurianDo try ice creams here it's the bestChats I give it a 3 star.Best is Breakfast here do try"
3,Kind of darshini types. Surprisingly chinese food was very nice we ordered singapore noodles and it tasted very good. Pretty decent and affordable place.
3.5,Decent and affordable place for bachelors and families.Yummy and hot dosas. Extra points for the strong filter coffee! Dosas are mouth watering and will definitely help you put on weight.
3,It located behind the SOUTH END metro station a small place with no seating . The cook were polite and polite . We had chicken rolls which was amazing . The chicken was well marinated and was a perfect roll .We also tries the VEG CHEESY PASTA was not that good as compared to other white sauce pasta . It was a cause for money overall . A must place to eat great rolls .
5,Place for pani puri and sandwich lovers.Masalapuri and veg sandwich is one of the best.Clean and hygienic.Service is good.Ambience is good.
2,I ordered for chicken fried rice and egg roll.... Fried rice packing was worst like they pack in road side food........ And in chicken fried rice there were no chicken at all it was like egg fired rice..... Totally it was below par food ..... Not upto mark

3,Ordered manchurian and paneer curry. The colour of the gravy was good but there was no taste to it. Manchurian was ok ok sort. Overall not value for money
1,Worst food ordered masala dosa got something else in the name of dosa that to very worst of all.Sambar is not good given salt water in the name of sambar worst food.
5,Quality Food..we regularly visit here for dinnerOnion & Panner paratha is a must try itemRice baths are superbMethi chappathi & veg curries are also..Tasty..
5,"Very good place for quick bites, very hygene homly food with very reasonable price. Here many variations are available, even davangere masale mandakki was excellent."
3,"We had been there for breakfast. It's a fast food outlet. Chapathi and enGai is is my favorite.They have a very wide variety for breakfast. Like shavige, idly vada, dosa and many more. The food is soo homely. And tummy happy"
4,Its a very small joint..self service hotel. Very tasty and hygiene is maintained. Homely food and rates are reasonable too. Variety of food available. Loved their brinjal curry . Dosa and Pitakpappu was best. Tried vadas idly shavigebath and lemon rice too. Those craving for homely food..its must advised place.
1,The food wasn't worth even half the price . The taste was horrible and the portions even less. I hope they start catering to the needs of the customer by making proper food as per their prices
2,"This is small eatery opened recently in Jayanagar.Decided to try this few days back.. They have a wide variety of menu.Sandwich, burgers, chats, maggie, twisters, Waffles, Ice creams and lot more.We tried, paneer maggie, chats, sandwich, mushroom roll and waffle.The panner dint seem fresh at all, either was not good or undercooked. Even the veggies in the roll were not fresh at all. Dint like it much.Sandwich and Waffle were good though.Pricing is very cheap, pretty appropriate i would say for the kinda place they are running.Overall very average, dont think ill be visiting again.."
3,"Called their Egg Masala Combo via Zomato, Rotis were not that great, Chicken Kebab and Egg Masala was average! Food was fresh though! Requires improvement!"
1,"While the sweets and Khara items are good, the chaat items are just average. The other thing missing here is smiling and friendly staff. Used to be a regular her but with so many other options available visit this place only when someone is specific about buying peda from here."
4,"The shop for all sweet lovers. Huge variety of sweet and snacks. I got confused about what to pick. There sweets quality are really very good. Apart from sweets I had their samosa, pav vaji, dhokla. They were pretty good and reasonable. Located at prime location amidst the hustle of Jayanagar, this place is surely worth try and money."
1,"Unreasonable!Had been here for our evening snacks. I took a vada pav and sev puri. Vada pav was average but the sev puri was a disaster! The puri used for the sev puri was the pani puri (hollow puri)! when I checked this with the chaat maker, he says that I had to order for Bombay shev puri if I wanted the flat puris. Well itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs your responsibility to let the customers know what each chaat menu has in it! Anyway never again."
4,Food - 9/10Service - 7/10Ambience - 8/10Food here is very good with lot of varieties. Very good place for hostelites and bachelors. Staff here is good and cooperative. Ambience is okay.

Must try the white sauce paste, Cheesy Nachos, especially the Chocolate waffle itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs yummy never had such a great waffle and last but not the least everyone must try the cheesy loaded mushroom balls they crispy from outside and cheesy from inside Yum it is."
5,"The best cafe to hangout... friendly staff.... hygiene as well yum food served with love ?Peaceful , maintenance upto levelMenu is interesting ..... pocket friendly best place to have delicious snack"
3,We had been just today evening.. ordered for red sauce pasta which was just in place . Onion rings had too much oil and tasted lil ewww... Lime soda was gud . Overall ok experience
5,One of the finest place to treat yourself with such pleasanteries... Be it for home delivery or at their own hub... Love the taste and their varieties... Waffle is just amazing... Crispy and delicious as it's served... My all time favourite would be their loaded fries stuffed with plenty of cheese... Followed with Mississippi mud stuffed with brownie and wildly decorated toppings... Amazing... It's simply a food lovers place to hangout...
5,Ever been in a situation where you just get this urge and cravings for something different?! This is the destination for that ????. #FoodizoIsBae Chef Jibran's amazing lip smacking recipe for pasta did wonders for my date ??
4,Visited the place a couple of times.Have tried the veggie nuggets and potato pops along. The prices are very reasonable and worth the price.The milkshakes are also worth a try.
2,"Tried white sauce cheese pasta . Omg so bad pasta ever had, not at all good . N for that rs. 130 .Pasta not at all mixed with the sauce , no vegetables nothing . Just plane"
5,If your a vegetarian must visit this place.. Very pocket friendly and the food range is wide enough to satisfy your taste buds. I tried waffles at this place it was very delicious and the Lebanese dish was mouth watering. I recommend everyone to visit this place for the different taste and experience. The staff was soo polite and friendly.??Overall food: 5/5Ambience:4/5Service:3.5/5(try to serve a bit early)
4,"What: fast food.Ambience: good.What I ordered: hot chocolate brownie and death by chocolate.Well, the place looks good and the food was good. This s a very new place and ambience is quiet good, the wallpaper looks different and elegant . You can visit this place in the evenings with frnds. Yes, I will visit this place again.."
5,Calm and soothing place. Amazing food served.Multiple options to choose from. New in town but sure to lead in the area very soon. ?? #foodporn
5,"Don't judge a book by its cover. In this case don't judge this restaurant by the size of it. I have visited this place accidentally with a friend recently. Though the place looks small, it is cozy and a perfect place to have some snacks or to chill out with friends. The prices are reasonable here unlike other places where the items are overpriced and orerrated. The menu is minimalistic and they are very good at what they make. I tried Masala French fries and was stunned by the taste of mayonnaise given with fries. The mayonnaise was absolutely fantastic. Cheers to the chef. I ordered Red velvet waffles tasted very good too. My ratings are 4.5 for this place because I would love to see these people have cheesecakes in their menu. Definitely will visit second time too"
5,Wow!? nice and cozy place to chill & hangout with friends. Ty are well knw at tr services with A1 fresh & quality food with vry reasonable rates....must visit??njoy
4,We had ordered drums of heaven.. chicken mushroom soup..mixed koithai and chicken American chopsuey..Ambience was okay-ishThe food was good... Finally got some good Chinese food around here...
4,It's a nice place to have chinese food .. Good ambiance... Service was a bit late...Overall very good... I had ordered schezwan noodles and the taste was pretth good
5,"Regular Customer here!We drop by here every week since my office is close by. Great service and amazing food. I recommend all their sea food, koithio, chowmien, Malaysian noodles etc.Also, this place has Zomato Gold which definitely has made me visit this place even more often.PS: You could definitely work on a better playlist which would add a lot to the beautiful ambience and artwork at your restaurant.Keep up the great work!"
3,"Lot of variety and decent pricing. Tasty wise food needs improvement. Ordered leefo chowmein, hao hao chicken and hongkong chicken. Noodles was a bit dry and lacked flavour. Chicken in the noodles was too dry."
4,We ordered prawns chowmein with chilly baby corn as the gravy. The quantity actually can be shared easily between two! The chowmein had good amount of prawns and the chilly baby corn was spicy as expected. I love chinese now. I will surely be back for more!
2,This place was really bad! Only soup was good. Starters and main course was way too bad. Wish I could write atleast a single good point about the food here. Lollipop was very bad! Chicken was not fresh! Bad taste! This would be my last visit here!
5,"Visited the place with colleagues and it was good. As a Gold member, this place is worth a visit again and again.Drums of heaven was heavenly.Veg Spring roll and Veg Fried rice were also great.Szechuan chowmein was okay.Chilly chicken gravy and American choupsey were utterly delicious."
4,We visited this place for a team lunch and being a weekday there was not much crowd.They have seating in 2 different floors and can accommodate good number of people.We ordered some Fried wontons and crispy potato for starters and crispy chowmein and Hakka noodles for main course.The service was very fast the food was good.Overall worthy of a visit.
3,The place is not that good for students and teenagers! It's like a family place thing but too small !The good was good and were well served !If you are ordering fried rice I would refer you to choose schezwan fried rice !
4,A true Italian restaurant in Bangalore.. if one has a flair for Italian food this is the restaurant to visit .. the pastas and the starters are to count for!!
4,Had been year long ago just to try fondue... From then became a big fan of Cheese fondue of Eurasia Jayanagar branch. Enjoyed the food thoroughly. Service was good.All fondue lovers must visit.Price:3/5(expensive)Food(fondue):4/5Quality and Quantity:3/5Service:4/5
4,"Eurasia is quite literally the godchild of Little Italy. The place is packed weekdays too. I would think the nachos, the pasta and some of the soups are outstanding. The place being totally vegetarian makes it even more awesome.I quite like the way the pizzas are different yet so authentic. I have been there several times and would surely go there again. Thank you."
4,"Ambiance: 4.5/5Hospitality: 5/5Food: 4/5Wine: 4.5/5A wonderful place for a nice Italian meal, especially for vegetarians, with lots of options on the menu compared to other Italian restaurants in general"
4,"Had been to this place couple of times and itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a pretty decent place, Simple ambiance and great food. Starting with Funghi trifolati is what we tried and which is a must try and spaghetti primavera as a main course and to end with Tiramisu. All the dishes tasted good. If youÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâre an Italian cuisine lover and live in and around jayanagar or in south Bangalore then this one should not be missed."
4,"This place with it's beautiful ambience and accessible location is a deal steal for all your Italian cravings. Certainly value for money and the staff knows their responsibilities so well. Cheers to the entire team. The food was delicious and out of all that we ordered we enjoyed every bite - from Lasagna to Tortellini to the Mexican tacos, it was all yummy!"
4,"Okay, to begin with the ambiance is not at all great. The food on the contrary is really good and it has to be as they charge sooo much for it. Hence I can say itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs expensive but the quantity of food they give per dish is stomach filling."
4,"I have been to Little Italy at Indiranagar before and had added Eurasia to my must visit restos.Finally visited this place for lunch today and I had a great time here! It was like a catch-up with myself and the ambience made it worthwhile.I ordered the veg quesadillas and cheese garlic bread for food. The quesadillas were served with salsa and cream. They tasted great and +1 for the garnishing.There was 1+1 on cocktails and I tried mimosa and spritzer. Mimosa was orange flavoured and went well with the food I ordered. The spritzer was minty fresh and had loads of tiny apple pieces, helping me end my lunch on a great note :) loved this place and the service."
5,"Loved the food. People who love Italian cuisine or who want to try it , this is ur go to place.Everything is just perfect.Must try the Special Enchiladas. It's too good.Pizzas are nice. You have various toppings n selections available. Also u can try the Pasta Al Farno , it's pink sauce pasta.Overall service , staff and quality is amazing."
3,"Eurasia, a Little Italy franchise!A good ambience as it has roof top , its peaceful for a Lunch and dinner .They have very interesting Menu and serves really quick.We hadLasagne alla NapoletanaCheese Corn BallsFantasy PizzaVeg QuesadillaFruit PunchShanghai surpriseDead woman walkingThe dead women walking was great and we really din like the Lasagne much.Though it's a little ""Pricy"" we had great girly lunch time!Food : 3.5Ambience : 4Service : 4Price : 3"
1,The food was prepared in dirty oil. Firstly it was very oily.And there were Black color particles on the fries and sabudana vada.I think goli is getting bad day by day.Quality not maintained.
4,"In goli you get the best vada pav. Classic vada pav, cheese vada pav, aloo tikka vada pav are my favorites. These vada pavs are literally hot and spicey. The chill they give with the pav is lit. One cool place for hot and spicey snacks."
5,The 1 st time I ordered paneer vada pav. It was really amazing and very crispy. There was a lot if mayo in it and that was the best part. It was very big as well. Loved it 🤩?!!
5,Goli was right next to my house but now it's closed. So I always ordered a cheese vada pav and cheese unglis. They were just awesome. But the only issue is that I'm not too sure about the hygiene. Rest everything is good and plus the cashier was kind.
5,"While passing on the road we say Goli Vada pav shop we like to try some pav it's is yummy and mouthwatering we tasted maharaj Vada pav,makkai palak pava, keshar kulfi and khajor kulfi and Limca very nice moment and the person mr.prakahh order taker helpful and friendly"
3,??? A very small outlet located at Gandhibazaar... Vadapavs from Goli's are my favorites.... This outlet also serves some good varieties of vada pav...??? Ordered Maharaja Vadapav with cheese and Goli fries...????? The fries were very crispy and deep fried...? too oily... The quantity of cheese in Vadapav was very less... Barely little cheese was spread...I have tasted the Masala Vadapav too... it's amazingly hot and spicy...????? Anyways it's worth for the prices though some items are overcharged.... Takeaway would be preferred... Ambience needs to be improved when compared to other Goli's outlets.. There are lot of files in the outlet and not that clean with on overloaded dustbin... A 3.5 rating just for the food...
3.5,Very bad service by the staff they are too lazy and they don't make an effort to make vada Pav. Vada PAv tastes ordinary these days. Sodas are also not that great
4,"They are serve good Mumbai style Vada paw . Only I disappointed with they don't warm the paw . But they have a good option and varaity , any way when we got Mumbai Vada pav in Bangalore it's great for me I am loving it..."
3.5,goli vada pav was the brand whch every one liked initially . Later they did not maintain their standard as before . The only plus point of this one is they deliver home through zomato delivery and swiggy too . So this has around 66 outlets all over the bangalore . It will be some where near to every body so u can order it online as well . The best part of the vada pav here is the big size of pav and different types of vada which we get over here . But anyways this is not the original vada pav wat we get as a perfect maharastrian cuisine . But this may satisfy your crave for vada pav . Also they make sabudana vada which quite unique and different .
4.5,"Well this is the place i started eating vadapav.The vadapavs here are amazing and worth the money.They keep starting new things like spring rolls, pizzas i hv almost tried everything here .You should try the potato wedges,schezwan vada pav and the masala vada pav for the spice lovers nice place should visit if u dont want your pockets to get burnt.Taste -4/5Value for money -4.5/5Would i visit this place again -yesWould i recommend this place -yessonaliboliya.wordpress.com"
3.5,"I am not a fan of vada Pav, but I like Goli for their cheese ungli and other fried and unhealthy stuff :)This place has a lot of unique flavours among Vada pavs like Schezwan, etc.The sabudana wada was hyped , but didn't live up to my expectations..Will I go there again? Meh!! :/"
3,"Decent place, like any other outlet of goli. Classic vada pav, cheese ungli are nice. Service is a little slow. It was a regular hang out for us from Jain college."
2.5,I remember the days when goli has just started in Blore and I congratulate them on their success.My all time favourite here is the masala vada Pav....ooooff spicyBut yesterday I kinda got stale smell and taste from the buns??Sabudana vada is horrible..always ???
3.5,"This was the first Goli Vada Pav store I visited in Bangalore, and used to be a regular here until a few months ago.Their vada pavs are not at all similar to 'authentic' Mumbai vada pavs, but they're unique and have a distinct taste/flavour. If you like spicy food, I recommend their Schezwan or Masala vada pav. Otherwise, go for their Palak Makkai or mixed veg vada pav.Apart from their vada pavs, other items aren't really that good. But all items here are certainly pocket-friendly.Food - 3.5/5Ambiance - 3/5Service - 4/5Value for money - 4/5Hygiene - 3.5/5Overall - 3.5/5"
3,"Really good looking and we'll maintained snack junction. However, I didn't get the taste of this Maharashtrian cuisine which I had in Pine and Goa. Hope they bring the taste to Goli's Pav bhaji."
2.5,This place is part large joint chain of vada pav..Place offer consistent material but the cleanliness is last point and the people who are handling food handles all the materials by bare hand in front off you...you will be little skeptically in eating the same..Place for self service is big but not managed properly...only stars is for price and food quality...but it has to improve if this has to run for long time...
2.5,Service was indifferent as was the taste of the food. The regular vada pan was average. I was told that the ingradients are delivered every morning. I was there at abt 1100 .
3.5,"Hankering for quick tasty snack,like a vada Pav?Goli is where the craving ends.One can find goli outlets in almost every nook and corner of Bangalore nowadays.The menu is very simple.My most favourite is the classic Vada pav which has nothing more than a Pav and a tasty vada.Cheese ungli, Makkai palak vada Pav and sabudana vada are a few must tries...."
3,"Was quite surprised to see no crowd in this outlet on a weekday afternoon. This outlet is not different than any other Goli Vada Pav outlets in Bangalore. Just like other outlets these people are also least bothered about the customers. I ordered Masala Vada Pav, it was delivered very quickly. Taste was just average. They haven't spread the chutney evenly on Pav. The fried chilly kept on serving desk was below average and not salted properly.Later I ordered Chat Malsala lemonade which was very poor. Soda used in it was not strong and it felt like jal-jeera. You can give it a try, but don't have high expectations.beingbakasura.com"
3,"Have Been here very long back.Aloo tikki and Makkai Palak are best you can have. Test vise it is little far compare to mumbai vada pav test. But yes best vada pav test you can find in Bangalore.Cheese ungli was test less, so dont try and last you should go for kesar pista kulfi.There was no combo available at that time and it's self service kind of outlet."
1.5,Highly overated brand and the pav doesn't taste authentic like bombay. Just another way to loot in name if pav. Very costly and unsatisfactory.
4,"Bangalore is filled with the Goli centers.. I like the Gandhi bazar branch because it is quite calm.I have tasted almost all the items herePersonally,Classical vada pav, makai palak vada pav Cheese ungli are my favoritesThe schezwan and masala vada pav are little more on the very spicy sideI am yet to taste the Brownie here... I dont like the sabudana vada simply because the other places have better onesThis outlet is situated right beside Aathithya hotel in Gandhi bazar..Perfect for quick bites to temporarily take care of your cravings :)"
3.5,New one for Chamarajpet... As said earlier best india burgers... beware here at this branch as the owner has the habit of fooling you in bills...
3.5,"One of the fastest growing chain in the City... Well known for best Vada Pav, they have atleast 50+ or more than that outlets in Bangalore... I have tried almost everything in the Menu including the Kulfi's... 2 things are my all time favorite...1. Regular Vada Pav2. Sabudhana VadaBeen to this outlet several times when ever i pass Gandhi Bazzar...Best part is Service is really good and quick.Taste: 4/5Quality: 4/5VFM: 3.5/5bangaloreepicure.com"
2.5,"Its a small cozy place, very much not the taste of vada pav, its an blend tweaked pav for the present generation.. Good menu some of them are worth the pay..."
2,Its a small shop located in Gandhi bazar.The Vada Pav's feel more like burger than vada Pav's.There are lots of street side shops which serves Vada pav way better than this place and are economical too.The vadas are oily and the veg vada pav which barely has any vegetables other than potato.
2,Their shezwan vada pav is inedible..feels yukky and toxic...
4,Pizza dinner from Ragoos - pili pili pizza. Tasty pizza and the crust was good too. Only pain point was the pricing- regular 4 slice pizza was 300rs.
4,Luv wid pizzas in this place...visited this place many times .... Tried almost all pizzas in menu wit deep pan... u can even coustimise pizzas here .... Polite staff ... Fast service....
3,"Have been there for lunch. It's a small cafe and have some good healthy menu.We have ordered following:Mexican salad which had corn, kidney beans and some chopped onion tomato with nachos and dressing. I will give **** marks for the taste for the salad.Veg soup which was average like a home made soup feel. My rating for the soup is ***Pink pasta- it was cooked in tomato sauce and was average in taste.Chilli cheese sandwich they served 4 pieces and sandwich was very good. Rating ****Fresh juices - ****Overall it was a good experience but they can improve on the ambience."
3,"Pure & Natural, an eat out at Jayanagar.... one of the cafe with healthy eating options. The location of the cafe...crowd...interiors and seating is good and interests us too.I have visited pure n natural several times. I like their noodles hot salad the best. This time we tried veggie salad... unfortunately they served without one ingredient mentioned in the description....paneer was missing. When asked the in charge very casually said.....""they would have missed it.... taste Will not change....do you really want paneer?"" This response calls for a 3 rating."
1,"We were here on a sunday. The time taken to provide seating was 45 minutes, which is way too long. We opted for Dosa Thali and boy were we disappointed. The tables are regular granite tables with steep chair. Supremely uncomfortable. To top it, they took almost 25 minutes to serve. Being an unlimited thali it was our understanding that dosas were unlimited, however, we had to literally hail down the waiter and ask him to get us a dosa (which were 1/5th the size of regualr dosa served outside).The thali contained: Dal, 2 types of chutney, 4 variety of dosa (pretty forgettable), rice sambhar and rasam. The sambhar and rasam obviously has color in it and were tasteless. I would not recommend this place to anyone ever. The servers are very good at ignoring you. The food served is not hot and overall this is just a waste of our money !"
4,Had a nice cup of filter coffee after watching the video from Delhi Food walk's Anubhav Sapra. Had to stand in a queue just for a Cup of coffee for the first time ever in my life. But it was worth the waiting. On weekends this place is always crowded in the morning. Thanks!
4,I have been to Maiyas few years back and today went for lunch. The consistency and quality of food is great. The taste of the food is still same.Will definitely recommend this place. Service was good. The dosa and poori thalis were delicious. Will definitely visit again.
3,Tried the North Indian food at maiyas as the South Indian section was crowded. The North Indian rotis and curry wasn't that good. The staff wasn't interested even in taking order. Overall not a good experience and will never try food at Maiyas again.
4,Traditional South Indian RestaurantI had heard a lot about Maiyas from my friends who stay in and around Jayanagar and got a chance to visit this place recently.The Hotel serves traditional south Indian (pure veg) food.we tried some of the lunch items and they were simply superb.Must Visit Hotel!!!
4,"Best known for delicious south Indian food, Maiyas located in Jayanagar is a restaurant where many people in the locality prefer this place.Must try -Masala SosaPoori SaguRava idliCoffee"
3,"We went for a Saturday breakfast. We had masala dosa,idly vada and kesari bath.Masala dosa and kesari bath was really tasty.We went around 9 but it was not that crowded.Good ambience with reasonable price.If you want to try south Indian food this is one of the place I will suggest but not the best.A family weekend morning breakfast can be planned here.My rating 3.5/10"
5,"The quintessential Bangalore eatery which every Bangalorean must visit! I tried the special meals section on the 2nd floor and it was impressive. The tangy jeera rasam acts as a starter. They serve thalis composed of various chutneys and palya(subzi) to go with a myriad of mini dosas along with sweets. Then, it's followed by puliyogre and white rice along with raita, curds, sambhar, rasam and papad. All this tasty food for only 200 bucks!"
4,"Had been here for quick snacks. Ordered plain dosa as well as coffee.Plain dosa is served with ghee, chutney. And then the hot coffee in this beautiful weather was very much needed.Ambience is good with decent crowd, though crowded. Recommended to all bengulurians and non-benglurians."
4,"""Keep it simple"" the right caption for this place. Taste of all food served and ambience is good and compliments each other. Typical karnataka thalli.... tasted good n filling for lunch."
1,Not really the place one needs to visit for breakfast. The dosas are too heavy on the stomach! The only good thing about this place is the coffee!
4,"Love their Mangalore Bun, Bajji and Rava Dosa!It's my all time favorite spot for a snack in the evening or for a quick coffee break with Hitesh Asopa ! ?"
3,"we visited this place on a normal week end afternoon . We wanted to eat the north Indian food so we headed to top floor restaurant named as ""dancing Kadhahi "".Place is quite and neat . Seating is comfortable and normal like most of the fine dine restaurants .We ordered Hara bhara Kababa and Tomato Shorba for starters . Kabab were not good but soup was good .We ordered makhana and raw Banana curry , Bondi raita and Missi roti for the main course . Curry was new recipe  and it was tasty . Raita was normal . Missi roti was not cooked properly and had some dust from tandoor. Looks like they have a broken tandoor .Overall food was good and staff and service was very good .Nice place to visit for a quick lunch . Food - 3/5Ambiance - 3/5Service- 4/5"
2,Just went for a quick breakfast on SundayLocated at busy junction at a walkable distance from Jayanagar metro station.ordinary place with very ordinary foodWaiters are least interested in taking your order and serving food.Quantity is ok.I am sureYou get much better food at better pricing in Darshinis around

3,ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a restaurant which isnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât too fancy or anything. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs more of a homely place.Has cozy sofas and chairs.I really like their neer dosa and chicken ghee roast combination.

3,Ambience of this place is simple but it has some charm. Food is okay-ish. Had a pizza and some tea. Pizza lacked flavour and the tea was the teabag variety. So nothing worth it. With cafes like this you atleast expect the food to be good so the people come back. Food and quality of service needs to be improved
5,"I very rarely give a full score but I really feel this place deserves the high rating. We are non vegetarians and normally don't venture into pure vegetarian places. This time however we thought we'd give it a try. Must say we were pleasantly surprised. Starting from the beautiful ambience when we stepped in to the service by the servers, everything was perfect. Didn't miss the non veg! I would definitely recommend the big nacho which was very different from anything we have tried at other places. The paneer dish also was very good. All this for a reasonable price. Very satisfied and would definitely visit here again!!"
5,Very good foodAmbience is also very goodStaff is very prompt and helpfulLocated in Jayanagar.Defintetly a must visit!!Their biryani was very flavourful.
4,"A very good family restaurant with decent veg food in jayanagar. Food is amazing with a wide variety of dishes and ambience is cool as well. We tried thili babycorn, paneer chilli tikka, fondue margarita and few other dishes. Rasmalai was just prefect which just melts in your mouth! Chocolate jamoon was unique with chocolate oozing out from jamoon.And finally ended the meal with pan shots.Fondue margarita is one of my favorite! Love it there. Do visit to spend a good time with family and friends."
4,"Another pure veg hotel you will find in Jayanagar, even though the rates are on higher side. It is worth trying for veg lovers.There are a few must tries in this hotel- Papdi pizza- Pineapple Shorbha- Bhatti ka panner- Birbal ki khicdhi- Potli biryaniFree pan shots is a Must Must try :-)These are some unique dishes which you may not in other places.RatingsService - 4/5Food - 5/5Kid Friendly - 3/5 (Only one kid chair)Quality - 5/5Overall experience - 4.5/5"
3,"Been here a long time back, the cuisine is different. But dont expect fast delivery especially on weekends and evenings. Had to struggle a lot to get our order through. Otherwise the foold wise is okay"
3,"Couple of nights ago I had the urge to have Momos n upon googling, this place came up which is roughly 800m from my home. Tried my luck that night. To begin with, I had paneer Momos n it was good. The draw back is u get only 6pcs for 85/-. The price is on the higher side n the quantity is certainly not enough. Then had their Veg schezwan Momos n it was ok ok. Nothing great about that. They have hot dogs, burgers n rolls too. I haven't tried that yet.. Will do some other day. Staff guys are polite. They have flavors that are confusing enough.. No other issues other than the pricing n quantity provided. Need to work on that. If the management is serious then they will have to think through this."
1,"It was a real bad experience.Thanks to swiggy I got some refund..I had ordered chicken steamed, fried n Szechuan... The steamed momo were stale n brown in colour.. while the filling was stinking bad.Ruined my momo experience."
4,"I have been visiting this place for over 2 years, and they make good momos and Paneer Pan fried momos is one of my favorites but Ambience is not so good"
5,These tiny Macarons are too yum... Specially I liked 2 of it .. pistachio and chocolate flavour.And in passion fruit Macaron the centre cream layer had but of tangy flavour which I liked the most ... Since I visited the factory outlet... There is nothing to tell about the ambiance. But the staff there was so welcoming I would definitely visit back to taste some of the other flavours. Which I eyed on orange chocolate and strawberry flavour. ... But the must try is chocolate and pistachio flavour don't miss.
4,"One Word Review - FantasticThis place has the best macaroons and eclairs, you can get in Bengaluru.They are baked fresh, taste fabulous and are beautifully packaged.Their tea cakes, Madeleine and Financier are a very good addition.I guess, this is a pick up store.Never been there, have only ordered online.Overall, it was a fantastic experience for me.Have ordered multiple times, never once was I disappointed.A no brainer place, if you are looking French pastries, confectionary and deserts."
5,"After reading a lot of reviews about this place, we wanted to try it out. The location was a little difficult to find out. The maps shows the accurate location, even then it is easy to miss. This is not a cafe, it is a factory outlet which is situated on the 1st floor. Ordered 4 macaroons- rose, Belgian chocolate, hazelnut and vanilla. They all tasted really delicious. They had packed it very neatly in a cute little box with ribbon. It is pretty expensive. I paid 294/- for 4 macaroons inclusive of taxes.epicuresdelight.blogspot.com"
4,"One of the tastiest macaroons in the city , since their macaroons are made of almonds. I have thought that it is a cafe but after visiting only I came to know that itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs their factory . But other than that the orders taken and the staff behaviour is good ."
4,"Tried Motichoor laddo and gulab jamun .Taste - 4.5Both the items were great and yumm.Ambience - 4If you are a sweet tooth , you should definitely try this place."
1,Really upset with the quality of biryani I got lumps of masalaSeemed like they didn't had food to pack as I ordered late yet the order got confirmed...........
3,"I orderd a veg noodles, mushroom fried rice and veg fried rice from this resturent. Delivery was on time packing is also good when i started having noodles it i feel like oily but i thought yeah little bit oil needs to make it but i turned it into different utensil. The oil is floating like water and then i didn't had a single bite also. Just the oil was problm. The other two items veg and mushroom fried rice was good. So, i rate it as 3 star."
1,Very bad experience in chicken hunt and not gud taste n quality don't order in this restorunt..i ordered lemon bone less chicken but he sent bone chicken after that no response from resturent
2,Checking wid d reviews I thought dt d food would be good .. But I was really disappointed wid d quality of d food wch was served to me..I really hope that thy improve their food quality ..
4,Have been a regular visitor here since many years and I have been disappointed only once in all these years(the gravy dishes were a bit too spicy on that particular day.) However that was a very long time back and I have had no issues ever since. Love their dry items and roast chicken. Their schezwan chicken fried rice and chicken manchurian are really good.(Fair warning... schezwan fried rices are bit on the spicier side so might not be liked by all)  They have not had home delivery service for a very long time but have started recently which is why I give them an extra 0.5(for convenience ;)) Ambience is not good. However great value for money!The quality had gone down in the middle.. but off late the taste is back to it's original glory. Wanted to rate it a 3.5 but rounding off to 4
2.5,"The Kababs & Grill chicken here are good.But,seating is an issue.This restaurant is on 100 ft road with open kitchen.i doubt that food served isn't hygenic."
3,"It has a Dabha kind of look , I've been here many times. Biriyani is not tasteless. Only thing worth trying is chicken tandoori and Kalmi. Other than that , nothing is great about this place ."
3,"Hold on to your hat, folks! I'm still a vegetarian, and yeah, I did dine here! Was just strolling around the area, and just dropped in to see if I could have a bite. Turns out, they do have some vegetarian options!There was a bit of a crowd, since it was a Sunday night. I felt quite awkward when I ordered a veg Biryani, since this place is so focussed on non-vegetarian food. There are very few tables here, which is a bummer.I got my Biryanai, and for just ?75, the quantity was REALLY large! Great value for money, to be honest. In fact, I could only consume around 60% of it, in spite of being famished! The quality was above average, but nothing great. The place could do with more seating, though.Food - 3/5Ambiance - 2/5Service - 3.5/5Value for money - 4.5/5Hygiene - 2.5/5Overall - 3/5"
3,Horrible food. Only tandoori chicken is worth it for the price. All other items have too much colour or rather tasteless. I would recommend going there only on a tight budget and you want chicken desperately.
1,Chicken huntttttt chucken huntttttt from so many days I was planing to be there but finally to day I went there nice place... but for less price we can have food but not good food not so good also bad...
4.5,Truly the best restaurant to have tandoori items! Ambience isn't that great as its a self service restaurant! But nothing beats their food quality and quantity at this reasonable price! I would say take away from this restaurant is the best option!
3,It was good with dhaba style. Afternoon time it was kinda hot because of open area!! Its little hard to hunt the place. I rate it 2.5 out of 5.. :)
4.5,I am a regular here and not even once have I been disapointed with their food.Don't expect much on the ambiance. It is a very simple self service joint. The rating I have given is solely for their food. Their prices are very affordable and is completely student friendly.The only one thing that lacks in this place is home delivery. They mention 'free home delivery' but not once have I got to talk to them over the phone. They never pick up! Management I hope you look into this matter.I recommend some of my favorties mentioned below -the chicken dum biryaninorth Indian dishes both breads and gravytriple fried ricechicken friend ricetandoori chicken
3,"Veggies are unfortunate for a place like this. The rowing kebabs and tandoors' just make you feel more hungry. The more you eat more you are satisfied. It may be a Dhaba short of place, but a perfect chicken ???? hang out place."
1,This place is horrible than a street food stall.... Sub standard quality of chicken. Avoid this place.
3.5,Chicken Items Is Sooooo Good Try It Guys
3,Not a good place.food not upto the taste and ambience don't expect any thing
1,We really need canine teeth to bite chicken hunt non veg items.... he will wind up soon....if he doesn't take my feedback consciously.
3.5,"Chicken Hunt is more of a small road side ""dhaba"". Food is tasty and it doesn't burn your pocket. So its a good place when you are damn hungry and want to just have food like a foodie."
3,"Have to ask the Owner / Cashier, why they named it ""Chicken Hunt""? Is it by design or did the designer (read 'painter') design it wrongly. This is 'darshini' style non veg joint....pre-pay the cashier, hand over the order at the counter, wait....wait...wait....wait..., your order is called, jostle for elbow space at the tall tables...gobble, gobble, gobble....go.What you need to do, is to get your order ""purrfect"" at the first instance i.e. number of dishes + number of rotis; else you are stranded and would have to join the aforementioned process queue.The food is quite good for the price and I would definitely go there again when the angst for some chicken tickles the brain."
4.5,simple place and awesome food but really at a good price. trust me I am a regular customer.
2.5,"Initially it was really good when someone from mangalore or udupi managed it.Now, you dont get the same dishes which you were getting before. Now all people from Bengal/ other Northern state preparing typical mangalorian dishes and obviously you cant find the same taste.And, vegetarian dishes is prepared on the same utensils which they use for making non-veg dishes . Yeah- name is chicken hunt. As my wife is pure vegetarian, i took her once and asked them for veg dishes. They prepared with same oil/utensils which they were not supposed to.Now the price has increased from initial stage. But it is really reasonable. Tandoor dishes are also reasonable. These days, I prefer Biriyani paradise (bunts) near Bank Colony. Better taste and more cleanliness !Initially i was loving this place. Not any more !"
3.5,"The food is quite good for the price. Butter chicken, Punjabi chicken and tandoori are my favorite. As said earlier it gets crowded especially in the evenings on weekends, you may have to wait to get a chair. This place is not for people who crave for ambiance, Its definitely worth a try."
4,"Small and sweet place, but awesome chicken! Can get crowded during peak hours, but this is real street chicken food! Don't expect too much.. you will not get better chicken dishes for the same price anywhere else! If you're ready to sit on plastic chairs in the open to eat great chicken, this is the place for you! Kebabs, Tandoori and Grilled chicken are the best! I recommend Reshmi and Zafrani Kebab! Chinese dishes aren't too bad either!"
2,"A quaint, family-friendly, vegetarian establishment. Too bad they take really long to serve you. The taste has been wearing off over the years, but they try (I guess). They better buck up to stay in business."
3,"Ordered from this restaurant for home delivery few weeks back . They had some special offer of dinner at Rs 99 going on .I ordered a Swadesh tadka special biryani combo .1. Veg biryani - The biryani surprisingly tasted good ! It had good flavour and it was spicy . The biryani was still hot when it delivered so it tasted even better ! The rice was cooked well . There peas and some other finely diced vegetables and leaves in it . I really liked it . The quantity was very good for the price . It went really well with the raita they provided .2. Gulab jamun - The Gulab jamun was your typical restaurant style , it was slightly towards hard rather than soft but the taste was still good , the sweet syrup also tasted well .Overall pretty impressed , the packing was good , the food was good, the price was good .My rating is 3.5"
5,"Ordered the paneer combo @100/-. 3 chapatis, veg biryani and paneer curry. A very filling meal at best price. Tasty food. Really loved the paneer curry."
4,"If you love sugarcane and don't want to catch an infection, fear about germs and hygiene then head to thus place.  Clean, variety of flavours in cane juice itself. Worth trying"
4,Cane juice over here is amazing. The have flavours to chose from..can ask for more addition of flavours..the place is decent enough and the way it's made is clean
3.5,"I love the popcorn here, Especially the fact that a packet is only 15 bucks.I usually buy 2 to 3 packs whenever I pass by & Keep in my room.Juices are not the best, But good enough to beat the heat."
4,"This outlet of Cane-O-La is located on the bull temple road. It's a very small outlet but they haven't compromised on hygiene and cleanliness. The preparation and serving are neat and tidy. Sugarcanes are stored in appropriate conditions. The staff is friendly and quick. The place is limited to serving freshly made sugarcane juice in an affordable price. If you want to drink healthy juice without burning a hole in your pocket, this is definitely a place to visit.myhungertales.wordpress.com"
3.5,The popular place serves cane juice that is kind of obvious after knowing the name. The place is serves different types juice and sticks to it's cane juice thingy. The best part is they don't use any plastic items not even straws.
4,"What can I write in a review for this? Just go take a sip of this ideal refreshing drink this summer & immediately feel the difference. Last evening, I was again walking past my favorite watering hole when I decided to go in & have just I mug. But it was so tasty & refreshing that I had another one. I usually prefer the natural flavor, but this time I had the ginger as well as the mint flavor. I just hope that these guys start using their gloves once again when they extract the sugarcane juice. They used to use the gloves in the beginning, but now they have abandoned it completely.Yes, I will be back to down a mug or two, but only is they start using gloves once again."
4,"One of the first cane juice outlets I guess. It's on the main bull temple road, two or three shops after Subway. Pretty easy to locate.It's a very small shop serving some good and hygienic cane juice. We can Atleast be sure of it rather than drinking from the street guys.I love their natural and masala flavours. My parents however swear by Ginger flavour all the time.It's a nice healthy and fresh juice.I usually end up taking parcels, they do a good spill-free packaging.Now that Sankranthi is round the corner, it's a great time to gorge on some cane juices. Their Jayanagar outlet (next to Cool Joint) is good as well :)knowfoodknowme.wordpress.com"
4,Who doesn't like a huge bottle of chilled sugarcane juice on a hot day.. Nothing more to be said.. One of the best places to drink sugarcane juice right out of the cane itself... Times when I used to visit cane o LA In basavanagudi I used to gorge on 4 glasses at one time.. Its a few yards from the dominos near base tutorials.. Give it a try
4,"As fellow foodies have already stated , this branch of cane-O-la is one of the first to have launched in Bangalore . This branch is Located on bull temple road serves fresh , hygiene sugarcane juice in flavours like lemon,ginger,salt and pepper ,chat masala apart from the natural all priced at Rs 15 ."
4,"In my very first visit to this Cane-O-La outlet I felt a difference in taste of Sugarcane juice. The essence of Raw Sugarcane preserved so well. I just loved it. I have tried other variety like mint, ginger, chat masala & lemon. But still, natural flavor stands above all.They use to sell quality chikki's before, but unfortunately they stopped it.Just enjoy the natural-ness of sugarcane juice with slow sips. You feel refreshed in minutes.beingbakasura.com"
3.5,One of the first cane outlets in Bangalore and the most authentic. Used to be adda for me and for my friends during engg. You also get the best pop corn here for just 15 bucks!!
5,The fast quench thirster.. Seriously very good sugarcane juice melaa...
3.5,One of the very first outlets of Cane-O-La..  Never been a fan of sugarcane but yet the juice ( At a very affordable rate) has surely made way into people's hearts.. Located in the busy Bull Temple Road.. just before the signal... this place is always bustling with people.. A healthy choice over the other Juice outletsI would be glad if they introduce some snacks too
4,"This use to be my frequently visiting Cane juice shop at Basavanagudi.... Nothing special about the taste, but we will get different options like Lime, pepper, mint and ginger flavored cane juices... They have introduced Groundnut and cashewnut Chikkis but it was not up to the mark... Price is affordable and Value for money... They have so many outlets in Bangalore.Quality: 4/5Taste: 3.5/5Hygiene: 4.5/5VFM: 4/5bangaloreepicure.com"
4.5,This place sells the best and freshest and hygienic cane juice .And there are a lot of choices of flavours.And it's economical too.
5,"Amazing fresh sugarcane juices....all natural....u can have it mixed with little bit of mint, masala, ginger, lime or have it plain just sugar cane :)"
4.5,Still remains one of the best option for sugercane juice in basvangudi.The cane quality seems pretty excellent. It reflects in the taste..Priced at 15/- bucks per glass. This is the best option to chill out in a healthy way this summer.
5,Refreshing cane juice. Two wheeler parking available.
4,Refreshing sugar cane juice. Light on the wallet and four different varieties availability. The place is difficult to spot even though it's on Basavangudi main road.
3.5,"If you are a sugarcane juice lover , you got the right place! Not much choices though, 4 flavors to choice from and all are pretty refreshing ! Very lite on budget"
3,The food is not that great and the same are priced high. It's not worth paying the price for the taste and quantity they provide. They can do better by improving the quality and quantity of the food. Or reduce the prices for the same quantity. Varieties are good.
5,I love their pomegranate juice its just tasty refreshing undiluted and amazing. Really good sandwiches too!! Keep it up. I am yet to try their other items but seems great.
5,I jus loved the rava dosa here. Had been thinking to eat from very long n so finally made it & just worth it. Apart from this the thair vada (curd vada) is my all time fav here. But never the less i like the masala dosa set dosa & idli varieties too.. Evening snacks like sandwiches & north indian platter for lunch are Remarkable... Must try.
4,"The place serves very delicious food, in addition to South Indian cuisine the vada pav and pav bhajji was surprisingly very very tasty. It's a must try. That said, the place is very small and usually you would end up having to wait for at least 10mins during peak hours."
3,"Really nice place for food of different cuisines. The North indian and South Indian food is nice. Both, the self service and the serviced areas are nice and kinda clean. The food tastes okay and it's really nice place to dine in/on a budget."
3.5,"Upahara Darshini is a multi-cuisine pure vegetarian restaurant near the Jayanagar market. The location is prime and it's a good place to dine in after some shopping.On a weekend evening, I did the same when I was with my family and we were tired and hungry after shopping. We went to UD and we were greeted well by the staff and within 5 minutes we got the seats as well.ORDER, TASTE, AND QUALITY:We had ordered Masala Papad, Filter Coffee, Chilli Paneer Masala, Malai Kofta, Palak Paneer, Garlic Naan, Gulab Jamun and Ice Cream.All the food items were delicious and cook the way they are supposed to be except the Malai Kofta, which was not authentic and not good. The Gulab Jamun was also not upto the mark.SERVICE AND AMBIENCE:Service was good and they served us quickly. The staff was polite and courteous.Ambience was decent."
4,Famous for its Masala Puri. People who've worked here have started off chaat shops themselves.Nice place to have a hot evening snack. The place is kept neat and service is fast.
4,Should try the dahi Puri and bhel Puri other than that masala Puri is niceSev Puri could be done betterThey prepare the server chaats really fast.Food-4/5Service-5/5Ambience-3/5
3,"Well always seen a big crowd out side this outlet but never had a chance to eat, This Sunday finally had a chance to walk in ;) Well was surprised to find out that they have just five items on their menu plus a softy and few ice cream flavours, to be honest I tasted all five but not happy with taste and couldnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât finish any plate;(Maybe I had very high expectations, but the place is well maintained and pocket friendly!"
3,It's a decent place where people with full of crowd. parking facilities is not available.. taste of bhel puri was good but aloo dahi puri was not upto the mark. It's just a normal chat house nothing so special..
5,"As the name says, this place has been the best of places to have chats in chamarajpet.This second generation run chat house is well know for the bhel puri, masala puri and pani puriMust try: masala puri, pani puri, and bhel puri#rajeshwrites"
3,"Nothing too special to say about the place. Looks neat and tidy but a bit cramped for space. It's a standing only restaurant with many chaat options. Tried the bhel puri which I felt was pre prepared since the bhel was soft and did not pack a punch. The dahi puri was nice, Sev puri was a bit too spicy for my liking and the Pani Puri sweet sauce had a chocolatey flavour to it which I personally don't prefer. The cut fruits were nice and fresh and also I had a chocolate ice cream cone which we all know how it is ?. Overall not a place to bust your brains out about."
3,"1.Outlet looks neat and hygine and the food ...2.Bit of a congested bike parking space.. car parking isa bit challenging3 They accept cash and paytm but no card4. Bhel Puri was good and I felt it was pre prepared since it crispyness of the bhel was missing5. Dhai Puri was very good and fresh...6. Sev Puri was also good and tasty7. Pani Puri was really good8. Fruit salad was good but no topping on it...when asked for some honey the server told - "" honey kalli agithe manager na kelli ?? ""Taste meter : 3/5Value of money : 3.8/5Over all felt like a normal chat shop and not what I expected after seeing zomato's title of this place."
4,??They serve one of the best softees? in the town.I just love their crispy wafer cone???I totally drool over themasala puri and Pani Puri of this place???I personally didn't like their BHEL puri much??Overall a good place to hangout with friends?Taste-4/5Service-self serviceAmbience-2/5
2,Horribly & extremely sweetIt was like curd in sugar syrupWe orderd pudina lassi & dry fruits lassi.Thre was no option of less sugar as well since it was readily made.Only Ambience is good.
5,"Few years ago, this place was ""just another"" lassi/juice shop, but now it's a ""new and improved"" Lassi Bar. Loved the way they have changed the look and feel of this place. Lassi and Mausambi Juice were fresh and tasty. They may have replicated Corner House's successful transformation story but they have done it better. Kudos!"
4,"A freshly renovated place from what it used to be earlier.One of the best place to have gudbud ice cream and mango lassi.The place is looking very modern and the staff is very courteous.The lassi is served in a matka, which gives a nice feeling."
5,Nice place to have a good drink. I prefer a simple old lassi. It got a real good taste. One of the best place I have had lassi in Banglore. Good place to have drinkable dessert time with your buds. If you are around here it's a nice place to go and end your night with. Loved the place as well as the people working. Will visit again soon.
4,Dry fruits lassi is just amazingWorth every single penny you spendCan be easily locatedDo visit this place for best lassi in the townAll the best
4,"This lassi joint serves some good lassis,milk shakes,ice cream sundaes, Faloodas,Kulfis etc etc.Located on the main road in Jayanagar 3rd Block.Must try."
4,"It was an awesome experience today visiting this lassi bar. We ordered Badam and Fruit Falooda and it was sooper! It was enriched with jellies, falooda and badam or fruits.. Kudos..."
5,Malai lassi. A must try out. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs too delicious to be true. I drank three glasses on my first visit. A great place to hangout with friends too.
3,There are a lot of varieties of sandwiches. It's decent. The Gobi Manchurian is good here and so is veg hakka noodles .The juices are good too.They should arrange for more seating.
1,I think I did a mistake by visiting this restaurant worst food we ordered something for parcel and got something else really unprofessional will never ever visit here by mistake the guy wearing a shirt named dada gave all wrong orders to us worst place
3,Chicken burgers can be better with some good quantity . good cheap price thoughOrdered a green apple mojito was quite good tbh wish to order again
1,Poor quality of food! My 1st and last experience with this place was very bad!Packaging was also not proper. I ordered steamed momos in which i got fried momos and that was also not properly fried and some pieces were broken as well! No chutneys with momos.This is how they prepare and deliver food.
5,"In snack bites have lot of varieties..and I have tasted sandwich ,momos,and pasta ..it's too nice ..I had never tasted before..I love Maggie..who loves Maggie and pasta please visit snacks bite..too yummy ????"
5,Yummy taste nice place and gud service satffs attitude all is gud and nice service listing music also gud we are visiting again also thank you for given nice foods
3,veg spring roll was too much oily..coudnt eat
1,very oily and teastless
3,"I ordered chicken lollipop, grill chicken and mashroom. I liked grill and lollipop, chicken was perfectly grilled and not expensive. Lollipop was just ok. Mashroom was not cleaned properly. Overall its ok"
4,Masala dosa and open dosa are delicious. The price is value for money for the quality and quantity. Does not provide variety of options though
3,Phulkas were too thick
5,"Healthy version of a Bengaluru Darsini. If you are looking for a quick yet healthy meal then this is the perfect place to check out. Also, they use eco-friendly plates & spoons which makes it an overall guilt free experience!"
5,Excellent place for healthy wholesome food.  I love all their millet recipes.  Bisibele bhath is their speciality.  Eat without Guilt.  I am happy that healthy food alternative is available now in Chamrajpet & Brigade road and now to my home thanks to Zomato.
5,"This is my favourite place to eat in Chamarajapete and Basavanagudi. Period. Great food, Low price, eco friendly plates and very hygienic. What else could one want?"
5,Really healthy foodI can totally forget white riceAnd affordable!Pure south Indian tasteAnd hygienic with environmental friendly cutlery!
5,"The best Live ice cream ever had with reasonable priceBest live ice cream !!! The flavours are unique and awesome jus loved it.... Loved Ur taste, ambience and service , waiting for more such unique flavours to come up in Bangalore .... All d very best !!!!!"
5,Well I ordered chocolate murder and it tasted absolutely delicious. The chocolate ice cream was rich and exotic in taste unlike the other ice creams I have had elsewhere. It had some mud pie kinda thing which was supposed to be topped on the ice cream with roasted almonds.But since it was delivered home the cake or the mud pie was compressed and mixed with ice cream but taste wise it tasted too good and sophisticated . I didn't like the taste of raisins in it thou . But overall the ice cream was a delightful experience taste wise would love to taste the other range .
1,"The service is not up to the mark and no value for customers order, as I called the v.v.puram parlour branch person to enquire availability of ice cream and he said yes but when I went there I was made to wait half an hour for arrival of stock and till then stock did not arrive.I am not complaining on the taste of ice cream but the thing that went wrong was the person who told stock is available but after going there stock was not yet arrived and I sincerely request them not to tell lies and make business cheap, We at the corporate level will never entertain these things and instead ignore to getin to such shops. Make sure these doesn't repeat again.."
5,"Life is like an ice cream, enjoy it before it melts .. ???? my partner @shanujain462 letÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs go soon for ice cream date ? best ice cream every tasted."
5,"GLEEEEE ??The excitement for eating icecream is always highest.IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâm so glad I visited havmore to try their range of icecreams.Though the place can accommodate only 3 groups Coz itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs quite small, but nevertheless I LOVED THE ICECREAM HERE.I was always a fan of havmore icecreams, from the Black Forest to the small chocolate candies.So I took Belgian sensation, couldnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât get over the taste of it. Just so Yummyyy.CanÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât wait to try all the flavours here."
3,This place was good for quick bites of tasty breakfastThe flavours were niceBit crowded and noisy place coming to their Service which was so goodvery friendly staffVery clean place
5,Highly hygienic and tasty food..... Both South Indian and North Indian food are good....Benne Masal dosa is my favourite food here.... Cleanliness is maintained
5,"I like that brahmins tasty foods. Superrrrr taste, sooo neat service, polite workers and i realy like this hotel, overall good experience...."
5,Good south and north indian foods at reasonable price. Benne dosas are good here. They also have a bakery inside which is good and reasonable.
5,Workers are very polite and food is very delicious. Good and fast service. Food is with reasonable price. Must try paneer satay if you are a vegi else chicken is awesome here. Loved the food.
5,"Too good restaurant, very good ambience, food really good, value for money, place is calm & more closer serene nature, very close or almost attached to TURAHALLI forest ?. Cost of food is affordable even if you hog food it cost 1000 rs for 2 person. I seriously suggest to visit once here."
1,dont order anything from here.... worst food... i had a stomach upset after eating here.  better to eat road side then ordering from here.Zomato should do back ground check before they add any new restaurants.....
5,"Arguably the best i can say! Regular customer and the food has been one absolute delight! Never fails to amuse me with the taste. The non veg thali, the signature chicken vada pav and what not! Must visit for those who lure for home made food! Suggesting everyone for it!"
5,"Newly opened in kumaraswamy layout, excellent taste and menu items changes almost daily, so you dont end up eating same thing daily.Things to try Pani Puri, Spanish Omlete, Jal Jeera Soda and Biriyani! Outlet is clean and tidy as well.Surprisingly the prices are low for the quantity and taste!"
5,"As they are starting, so I would love to promote them. As they have cleaniness and great hygiene. It's healthy. Their biryani is good. So does jal jeera soda."
5,"Ohh they have in kumarswamy too. I will order from here. I have some friends who are a fan for this place . Guys best of luck , I hope your efforts gets appreciated a lots in Bangalore."
1,I placed my order via Zomato and was very highly disappointed. Quality is poor they served flavoured rice for chicken biryani and without chicken. Quantity is extremely poor. Cutlery is fine but that doesn't add value to the overall experience. I wouldn't recommend this place for good quality food or quantity.
1,I have ordered food they had sent me message that food is on the way and after 20mins they sent that the order is called that too in the night if it is in the morning no one cares . They very careless and thinks its okay we can say anything to customer
5,Was a FreshMenu fan but this carried me way !! Packing style is mind blowing so is the food !! 10/10.. yet I felt gravy is too much but itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs still more tasty for people on extreme diet and crave for spice with super low carbs and sodium
3,"very less quantity for the price, but it is good"
5,"Nutritious & Sumptuous food! Excellent taste, never knew brown rice could taste so good! The Biryani was really good, never missed the white rice in it! Miler dish of the day is a great healthy & pocket friendly option too!"
5,"The food is great. I have ordered most of the items. The food is hot, tasty and healthy. Still looking forward for more items on the menu. ????"
1,"Spice mixed nuts is totally waste as it contains 95% Peanuts only, total waste of money"
5,I feel this is the perfect place where you can go to for a clean bulk this winter ;) Get them gains. The food is very tasty according to my taste buds and i as a bodybuilder would recommend this to everyone in the fitness industry.
1,i dint get wt i ordered
5,I ordered the authentic Rajma masala with Brown rice. The rice is perfectly cooked and the taste of rajma is amazing with very limited oil used. However I felt the portion of rajma could be increased as compared to the rice served in a bowl. Overall it is a perfectly balanced meal ?
5,Good atmosphere ....lovely place n friendly staff the best place to spend the day..we had crispy corn which was delicious and service is great
1,The only sandwich which i would recommend is spinach corn and others are either too dry or bland.All in all you can visit this place on monday when they have 50% off on entire overpriced menu and will be worth ur money.Taste-1/10Staff-2/10Value for money - think before spend.
4,Bread was a bit hard to eat
5,For all the sandwich lovers out there..this place is a must try one.not only fills your hunger..makes your taste buds really happy?🤩🤩??????????????????
4,"Was here to this new venue for breakfast on a weekend.We were given a warm welcome by the staff and the owners. Started out with a fresh fruit juice and had plenty of options coming in.Their menu is unique and much different from the regular breakfast hotels. Their ambience is neat and standard.Their menu caters to various tastes and have a few fashion dishes as well.A must have would be the banana kesri bath, butter masala dosa and their filter coffee.Do try out their spring roll dosa if you are in the mood to try something new and you won't be disappointed.Loved the service here."
5,"Udupi sri krishna cafe , is a new restaurant that has opened in jayanagar area , they have a wide range of items to choose from the menu, the prices are really competitive, the ground floor area is a self service section, first floor being the ac service hall and second floor is the party hall. The ambience and hygiene are impressive, I visited this place recently to have breakfast with a bunch of friends, they do serve special items like banana kersi bath and pineapple kesri bath , the star dish for me was the spring dosa, which was very crispy and had wonderful fillings inside it , they also serve fresh fruit juices here .Ambience:5/5Taste:5/5Service:5/5Value for money:5/5"

5,"Best place to hangout. Don't forget to try Dum Biryani, Gobi Manchurian and the yummy cookies. Baby corn crispy with garlic sauce is one of the best picks for vegetarians.For light snacks I highly recommend you to try the starlight special puffs."
1,Very bad quality food.Poor delivery serviceArrogant personnel.They served my lunch with morning prepared.Please dnt order from here.Thanks
5,"I have visited this place for a couple of times. It is a must visit for biriyani lovers and most of the dishes are authentic and mouth watering. The service is above par with decent interiors. They have taken care of the hygiene factor by serving food in banana leaves. The dishes are blended with both authentic Karnataka style, North Indian and Chinese. The menu now being updated with veg items as well it is a must for a family or a group consisting of both vegans and non vegans. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!"
4,"I Have been to this place couple of times and believe me the food (to name few-Mutton/chicken biryani, lever fry, lemon chicken, thandoori chicken, Kalmi kabab...etc) is good and tasty.Will go there again to try more food items."

5,I loved the momos. I had called them at their closing time for take away. The prepared the best momos in that moment and gave it to me. Loved the service. Such a polite staff.
4,I ordered takeaway from here. So I don't know about the decor or the ambiance. I ordered leefu momos on Zomato and it arrived promptly.The momos were hot and drenched in leefu sauce (?). It was delicious. This seems to be a good place to order desi vegetarian Chinese food.
4,"Simply awesome, authentic and pocket friendly, but limited options.I tried hot and sour soup and Pasta, both were amazing...On the ground floor you have chat options as well..."
5,Tasty Chinese food in the surrounding.. one of its kind tht serves authentic Chinese food.. Must visit.. lovely ambience and pocket friendly..
5,This place serves some best food in and around Basavanagudi. Chinese and italian cuisine. Prices are very attractive and the ambiance is good for all age groups and families. Best at their service. Polite and friendly staff.

5,"Awesome place to have benne dose ,This much of taste I never had in Banglore ,No tension to park vehicles, sitting facility is there and they are using Nandini butter."
3,"Straight to the point.Ordered food from this outlet thinking it's another branch of the Davanagere dose in BEML layout, Rajarajeshwari Nagara which is outstanding.Feedback.beNNe dose - 4/5 stars. Very good dose. Recommended.Idly - 1/5 stars. A total Disaster. Not soft, dry. Just not the idly you wanted. Please work on it.Chutney - full of garlic, least expected in Coconut chutney. A total put off. Subjective, for me it's a nono.So a very good place for dose.Idly - Need to improve a lot. Just not idly.Request: Why do you add garlic to the chaste coconut chutney? Please don't do that.Rating given only for Idly and Dose. (Not chutney)"
5,This one is the best of the Benne Dose restaurant.The taste of dosas are mouth watering delicious...Reasonable price for all variety of dosas...

5,Good food great taste and good packing and really great quality and really happy with the food and quick delivery.. good food great taste .. zomato should really tie with such restaurants
4,"I was looking for vegetarian restaurant to go for dinner and finalised on this. On reaching that place, we realised it was only buffet place and we decided to give a try.Place is spacious and seating arrangement was nice. I wonÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât put it on fine dining but casual dining place. Staff is friendly and addressed guest with smiles. Service is quick and prompt. But they only served soup at table and all other things one needs to picked by self.There were two options in soup and out of those tomato shorba was good. They have good spread but not huge one. There was live counter for chaats, pasta and certain other items. Desserts was okayish and options were limited. But I liked their dahi bhalla which was really good.Ambience: 3.5Food: 3.5Service: 4"
4,Food 4/4Service 4/4Ambience 4/4Cost 3/4It's one of the place to have full fledged Veg buffet. Nice place to go with the family.We have been there on 1st of jan for lunch. We have waited for an hour to get a table.Buffet spread was nice. We really liked the white pasta and chats.Grill was not done properly for many of the items. May be because of the crowd.We liked the desert spread also. Overall we had a great time.
4,"Been here for a team lunch.Very nice ambience.Parking is a problem as you have to park your vehicle on the main road outside the restaurant beside a no parking board.However,since they collect parking charges I assume they would be taking care of the parking with the civic authorities.Reducing 1 star for this factor only.The place is very spacious.The service is very good.This is a must be place for a strict vegetarian as there lots of items for them when compared to bbq nation and other similar places.Howevwr,still a little tough for a hardcode non-vegetarian like me :pThey have a very vast spread of items ,i.e 4-5 vegetarian starters,live pasta & chat counters,7-8 types of desserts,veg biriyani,noodles,rice,sambar,paneer curry etc.Loved the paneer curry.the best part is all this is for around 450 rs.U get 10% discount on corporate bills..A must visit place for hardcore vegetarians."
2,"The place has a nice ambiance and comfortable seating. Strangely we were made to wait half hour even though the restaurant was almost completely empty.The buffet spread was ordinary and bland. The salads were fresh but tasteless, starters were extremely oily. We had some paranthas which were good , but the sides were quite forgettable. The worst part was the service! We got our soups midway between the meals and The server made us wait long to simply get cutlery on the table and then made us change the score on the feedback form. DonÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât know why I paid the ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâservice chargeÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâNot returning again"
5,"Yummy yummy yummy.....made my tummy happie happie happie. Being a public holiday, the place was crowded....but the staff was very courteous and ready to be at your service. Food - delicious. Fav - alishan kheer, Hyderabad dum Biryani and the little tit-bits for starters."
5,Loved the place! The ambience was good and the staff were courteous. The place was like a heaven for vegetarians! Lots of varieties and the food was absolutely delicious.
5,"Was at this place on a weekend early dinner. This place was properly lit and super crowded. I am.not a vegetarian love but I loved every single dish I tried.I tried the following dishes :On starters I ate - Bhindi kurkure, rajastani baby corn, amritsari paneer tikka, tandoori kasundi aloo, veg ball chilli ginger dry. They were all so full of flavor and just tasted beautiful.Also had some items from the main course - amritsari chhole, dal makhni, subzi pathankot, subz methi mehak, veg hakka noodles, penne Alfredo, spaghetti peppernata, cheese chilli paratha, ajwaini palak paratha, aloo paratha, paneer paratha. Since I went during the paratha festival I was lucky to try them all. Specially served with a variety of achaars it was lovely to eat them all.Then there was of course the desserts -saphedh cham cham, badami semiya, and doodhi halwa.Ending the buffet on a sweet note. Loved the Ambience and service too. Will head here soon to try more veg dishes"
4,This is beautiful restaurant for the people who like veg food. Buffet of veg counter is set and also live counter. Staff is courteous and polite. Ambience was good. Food was tasty. You can enjoy with your family and friends
5,"This Restaurant is one of the Best for the spread of items for Buffet.Here are the list of things it offers.Chats SectionStartersMain CourseDessertsLive Pasta SectionLive Sweets Section etc.The Desserts section is the best as it has a wide variety of items like cookies,pastries,ice creams, 4-5 different varieties of sweets,custard, etc etc.Totally worth trying this restaurant."
4,"It was a family outing and since there are hardly any restaurants that offer pure veg buffet, Subz was on the list for a long time.The place is easy to spot.Ambience is good. I would rate it a 3.8/5The varieties of food was simply super. I would rate it a 5/5.Taste was good, live counters were amazing as well.Overall I rate this restaurant a 4/5 and worth visiting and the money you pay for the buffet."
4,Food was nice but I had heard a lot saying this is the longest vegetarian buffet place but in reality I did not find too many dishes. Taste wise it deserves 4 rating without thinking.
4,It's a veg only paradise. Have been here for multiple family function celebrated here. The best part of this restaurant is range of sweets like jalebi which is perfectly baked. I liked paneer tikka(it is always there) dal makhan veg jal frezi mushrooms all good. I liked their mouth fresheners after paying bill :-). They are good but they should get newer dishes in their menu to bring old customers again and again.
4,"Good North Indian restaurant in VV puram. Excellent ambience. Bang on service. They rock at it. Fried Masala papad was the tastiest of the lot.We ordered tomato soup, veg manchow, gobi manchuri, paneer pahadi tikka, masala papad, dilkush kofta, paneer tikka masala, dal makhni, roti, naan, paneer peshawari kulcha, veg biryani.Paneer kulcha was a rip off, 140 bucks. Could have been priced 90. Gobi Manchuri was crispy and good. Gravies were hot and kofta was soft. Garlic naan had pungent taste of garlic which was a put off. Biryani portion size can be relooked.All in all a good experience and would come back for great family dining experience. Ambience 5 on 5, service 5 on 5, taste 3 on 5, VFM 4 on 5, friendly and helping staff. Car parking available. They also run an ice icream parlour just next door by the name Old Mumbai. Tried their almond fudge. Was marvelous. Do give it a try."
2,Ordered gravy and dal khichdi- tasted find initially but when we woke up this morning was down with food poisoning. Not sure which one affected us. Everybody who ate is currently sick!
3,Good food with average ambiance . Good service.Visited the place at afternoon hence it was almost empty. Quick service. Great taste with sufficient quantity and affordable price
3,"Had been for dinner as my friend suggested. The prices were reasonable. We tried few dishes and we liked the Papad Churi. We suggest the restaurant to serve hot dishes. We ordered Kaju Rice which was warm and very hard. Did not enjoy much.Also staff are very patient less, we were still eating our food and they were behind us to serve or clear plates. I request the team to wait and clear the plates or serve the food. Ajay BabuPrice:3/5Quality:3/5Quantity:4/5Ambiance:4/5"
4,"been here for dinner and found out how tremendously it got itself transitioned from the beginning till date.staff was very courteous and professional. service was great and food was tasting pretty good.ordered roasted papad and veg manchow soupboth were tasting pretty good.and as part of starters, we had ordered gobi angare and crispy vegetables.even though gobi was little over boiled, the blend applied to it was tasting good and same the case with crispy veg.then we had chosen laccha parata and missi rotilaccha parata was just okay and when it came to missi roti, it was tasting pretty plain without any salt.later figured out this was supposed to be prepared in the same way.over all it was a nice dining experience ?"
4,"Pocket friendly food joint ,soups are just 15 rs taste is 5 star best soup are hot and sour ,manchow soup .Best dishes are mushroom fried rice and noodles . Potato Manchurian,Panner Manchurian.Best place to have and I strongly recommend this place."
4,"Ordered Panner Fried Rice and Chocolate Milkshake, food was hot, delivered on time.Taste of fried rice was good, milkshake was also very good, but I didnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât like the packing for milkshake , apart from that nice."
5,"Ordered Veg shezwan noodles and dear god, it was actually spicy! Pretty good quantity for the price and it's tasty as well. Quick delivery. Lemon and mint juice was a little too sweet. Savior hunger pangs which is close to my abode! ?"
4,"I happened bro visit this place by chance. Thanks to rain that I stopped at this place and also had food in here. I had manchow soup, baby corn manchuria and schezwan fried rice. All this had great taste. Manchow soup did taste very good may be because I was drenched in rain. But no doubt this place serves tasty food.The thing I like about this place is the type of plate food is served in. It is very handy.Overall I would rate it 4.5/5"
1,I have never seen such a bad restaurant. I ordered food from zomato and food is spoiled. DonÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât ever dare to order from this hotel. They just cheat by naming as Hyderabad express
5,"I love Hyderabadi biryani, So IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâm eagerly waiting for this restaurant to open to have a great meal. I and my buddyÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs are really waiting for this restaurant to open as we can meet up and have a good and healthy meal.??"
5,Food is really awesome the packing of food looks niceGood. I tell my friends and cousins also to visit this site.there are many flavors in ? chicken I tried two of them...
5,"Waiting to have food in Hyderabad Express, because it's hydrabadi, and hydarbadi food is so tasty, every one should taste food from this resturant"
5,"Good and satisfying taste of biryani,nice to see people are coming with such deliciousness in food, thank you so much Zomato,ur fulfilling your word's with restaurant likeHyderabad express in taste and authentication n hygiene"
5,"I'm waiting to taste this delicious taste of Hyderabadi biryani, good food and good services I expect ,youth taste and people of Hyderabad Love this platform Big thumbs up for ur restaurant"

5,"waiting very curiously ? awesome delicious food, amazing time management , and soooo freaking delicious! best hydrabadi biryani and taste thanku"
4,"Been here for Dinner with family. Food which we ordered was avg and nothing special was in it. It is just like optional veg restaurant.You can try once if you have no other option. As in every Punjabi restaurant, Lassy is good to taste.My ratings are here.Food 3.5/5Service 4/5Ambiance 3/5Location 4/5Overall it is an avg category restaurant."
2,"We ordered Aloo Mattar,Pudhina paratha and Methi paratha...was not very satisfactory as the parathas were bit raw and burnt and the Aloo mattar was not so yumm"
3,"Had the thali here , the taste was good and the amount of items were not many. They can be more competitive and refine the taste ., Cause the items on the menu are carefully picked and a good choice, the taste can be better. The ambience was quite and bright as there was only one other table full. All in all a fine lunch experience."
4,Really good punjabi cuisine available here! Must try their stuffed paratha and paneer curries. And donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât miss out on the lassi. YouÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâll love it!
1,"Food - 1/5Ambience - 4/5Service - 1/5Must Try - NoneClue - Had ordered egg whites omelette, which was super oily and charged 60 ? extra for making it with only whites. Also had a cold coffee which was too sweet. Had a brownie too which was so average. Outdoor seating decor is good, but infested with mosquitoes. The owner who sits near the entrance was frowning as I was trying to greet the super cute Shihtsu doggies lying down at the entrance. IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâm really not sure how and who gives this place high ratings."
3,"Food / Drink - Pizzas and pastas. And some deserts. A few soft drinks too. Simple menu. Simple pizzas presented in a very non pretentious fashion. Thin crust is good. Tastes good. Margarita pizza was a tad bland. Sun dried tomatoes were out of stock! Overall, not a bad pizza place for a quick bite.Price - Priced well. Good value quotient. WonÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât terribly pinch your pockets.Service - Very friendly staff. Orders taken fast. Food is delivered fairly quickly.Ambience - Indoor and outdoor seating. Covered outdoor space is well laid out. Again, simple interiors and nothing fancy.Location - Opposite to Banashankari BDA complex.Parking - Street. Or in the BDA complex.Speciality - Pizzas and pastas.Must try? - Nah!Pro tip - Pick nice veggies as toppings for your pizzas. Obviously youÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâd say?"
3,"I had plans to visit this restaurant ever since Zomato promoted with Vinny's video and felt it does not deserve all the hype.We went ahead with Onion Rings, Thin crust pizza slice, Alfredo sauce pasta and Red Velvet cake. While pasta and onion rings tasted good, pizza and cake were a disappointment. They were just average and the cake was dry! Top of it slow service and we had asked for items we ordered on a sparsely occupied weekday afternoon. Pups and dogs were not responsive at all, So if you are planning to visit due to the pets - You better avoid it. 3* for pasta and onion rings. I may not visit again."
4,Went here for lunch and found this place quite peaceful to sit with friends. Pizza which we ordered was great. This place offers you varieties of Continental and you can even go for slice if you don't prefer 12' pizza. Go for this place if you want fire wood ?!! Food and ambience is good.
5,"Been here a lot of times and the consistency of the food and service is pretty remarkable. Never really had a bad experience. It's known for Italian food, especially pizzas, and they taste really good. One of the few places that serve pizza by the slice as well. The prices are very reasonable. The service is good too."
3,"Have been wanted to visit this place from long time. Finally visited this place which is located in Banashankari 2nd stage opposite to BDA complex.As soon as you enter this place, you can just smell the aroma of pizza which will make your stomach crave for eating.The place has many seatings. You will have outdoor seating as well as indoor seatings. On some days you can find cute little shihutzu dogs walking around you which brings joy on your face.Well, coming to the foodOrdered,1) Mozzarella sticks which was very hot and cheesy cheesy and was really yummy which was served with a chilly sauce.2) Alferdo veg pasta was quite sour and quantity was less. Taste was not as expected.3) Paneer Tikka thin crust pizza was hot and creamy with pieces of paneer and dew vegetables on it. Taste was quite good.4) Caramel custard dessert, must try dessert in this place. The dessert was really soft abd mouthwatering.Service- was really good and quick."
4,"Food-4.5Ambience-4.0Service-5.0This is a cute little place right on the main road.Coming to the food I've had the chicken lasagna,alfredo pasta and veg pizza mostly the 3 toppings.One of the best Italian I've had in the city and the service is great and the food is bang for ur buck.Worth a visit if u love Italian cuisine"
4,"My first visit to Vinny's can be summed up as a good one, we were full before entering the place and were basically looking to kill time! Ended up ordering the BBQ chicken pizza and the Margherita pizza (both slices), the thin crust makes it feel lite on the tummy and the chicken was replicating the BBQ feeling to the fullest..We also tried the Caramel custard and loved it too, it was fresh and was nicely done!Next up would be to come here on a weekend and try a full sized pizzas.grubitizer.com"
4,"If you have cravings to have a authentic wood fired pizza this is your place . ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs newly renovated now and more spacious than before with 2 small wallgardens inside . And outdoor seating is well lit and who wants to sit between 4walls as obvious ? food here I recommend chicken bbq pizza , mozzarella sticks , cheese garlic bread , panner tikka pizza paired with virgin mojito ? very neat place , good ambience . One of the best place to have wood fired pizza in south Bangalore ."
4,Place is really neat and very good... U mat see few pet dogs of the owner inside but they are very very friendly... Pizza is good and the pasta was awsomeeeee.... They could have built a restroom though...??... When asked the worker they told they don't have a restroom... But other wise everything is good... U can park ur vehicle opp inside bda complex
3,"Food 3.5/5Service 3.5/5Ambiance 3/5Price 4/5air conditioned NoQuality 3.5/5I'm not found any special in this.. there plus point is , they are prepared their own pizzas and using garden fresh green vegetables.place was not maintained well clean..pizzas were thin in size but big prefer soft :(Milk shakes were taste and quality was not satisfied :(Dessert were not worth .All over one time visit but need lots of improvement in service and quality of food.."
4,"They have the best Pizzas in town. Also, the desserts are amaze too. Iff you love pets and pizzas, this is The place to be. Although m a lil disappointed that you don't get to see dogs in the evening bcoz they r either munching or sleeping or tired of whole day fun. But, anyway you have pizza for rescue.!!"
4,"Food - 4/5Ambiance - 4.5/5Service -4/5Beautiful place with wonderful vibes. Wonderful food along with great ambiance and service. Another highlight here are the dogs that are usually present there most of the time.The service is quite prompt and efficient, the food quantity offered very much matches the quality served. Great place to hangout or chill with friends/fam any day."
4,"We had our get together with our old friends and nice hangout in Banashankari BDA complex.It has wonderful pizza, kids loved the french fries.We had tandoori pizza along with 5 toppings pizza and both were very good in taste.Not to forgot the Pasta and Drinks.Ambience - 3/5Taste - 4/5Service - 4/5Kids friendly - 3/5"
5,"If you are looking for a quiet place in banashankari to sit back relax and have some nice grub, well this is the go to place. Located just beside the BDA complex, this place gives you a nice homely feel. The service is pretty good, but the ambience is also pretty superb. Adding to this there is Muffin and Aldo, the 2 cute cute lil dogs of the owners that walks around spreading smiles on the customer's faces. Coming to the food part, we had the Roasted Chicken pizza which was pretty decent but not something too woo about. Whereas the woo factor came in to play big time when we were served the Alfredo Chicken pasta(spaghetti). The sauce was absolutely blissfull, creamy and cheesy. The spaghetti was cooked to perfection and the chicken inside the pasta was also pretty tasteful. For washing this down we had the Butterscotch Punch and the Mango delight. Overall the experience was one to remember and I definitely would jump on another chance to go here."
5,"This place packs a punch both with its ambiance and food. The place gives you a calm feeling which can relieve your tension.Coming to food, they provide pizzas in slices as well which is a quarter of the 12 inch pizza. I don't like thin crust pizzas but this one was really worth a try. Everything was in right proportion be it cheese or toppings.Next we tried lasagne which was good in taste but to be honest I have had better ones at other places. It had too much tomato flavor. My advice will be to go for some pasta instead of lasagne.Mozarrela cheese sticks is an awesome innovation by Vinny's and is a must try.Last but not the least, we tried Tiramisu and Banofee Pie in desserts. Tiramisu tasted just like an ordinary pastry and you should definitely give it a pass.Banofee Pie was out of the world and is the best that I have had in Bangalore and Delhi combined.A must visit place for non-drinking weekends."
5,Yummy it was !! The pizza's and the deserts both were very tastyyyy !! They are huge in size which fills 4 people's stomach at a time... the liquids are also good
3,Reading the reviews I was expecting really awesome thin crust pizzas but the pizza were good but not awesome or great as I was expecting it to be.The pizza are not thin crust and the taste was average. The staff is good but need to be trained to suggest people options if people are in the first time. In terms of ambience its actually a house converted to a sit in restaurant. If you love dogs there are 4 cute shitzu dogs around the restaurant.
4,"If you are expecting a palatial dining and a gala menu, Vinny's, with a limited menu, may not be your place. But its definitely a perfect spot for tiny getaways, while its thin crust pizzas cater to your taste-buds with perfection. The pasta too is equally impressive."
4,"Lovely pizza, soft and crunchy crust, very cheesy, good quantity of toppings. Ordered three topping veg pizza.Chicken Lasgana was juicy, saucy, and was loaded with cheese.The place was crowded for a Saturday night, but the ambience was still very lively and fun. The service is also great. Would definitely visit again."
4,We get the best and amazing pizza I here try mozzarella cheese sticks and 3 toppings pizza they make the best and worth for the money ambience is not that good.. And the best part is it is an pet friendly cafe they have 4 cute little shih tzu ???
4,"The vinnys in Banahankari is pretty close from my work place so any cravings of eating Italian, and we end up there!The food menu is limited but everything on the menu is perfect as it could be! The pizzas are thin crust and they either server it full or by slice (which I think is a great option). The mix sauce pasta is fabulous, extremely creamy and rich(a must try).Do try the virgin drinks they serve (especially the lemonades in different flavors although I tried the cranberry lemonade on my last visit, wasnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât the best)The ambience is very casual and is easy on the pocket!"
4,Ordered the veg pasta from here on a day of intense cravings. The pasta was excellent. Spicy and filling. And for the first time ever even the broccoli tasted good. Can't wait to go there myself and try their food!
3,"Average non veg pizzas, they just have a single topping that wasn't too great, tried the bbq chicken, however, veg pizzas with the custom toppings turned out to be much better.But for their price I don't feel its value for money, since, I have had much better pizzas. Also, they could do with a smaller size too. Their French fries with chat masala was nice. Overall an average pizza experience."
4,Food - 9/10Service - 8/10Ambience - 9/19Cost - 8/10One of the best place to have pizzas in bangalore. They have wide variety of pizzas and drinks to have. All freshly prepared in front of your eyes. The ambience is very good with soft music.
4,"Good ambiance, and they have the cutest doggos!! ? That's probably the best part! Lol, jk jk. The food was equally good. The pizza was very nice, drinks good too. The nachos could use a little work, rather replace the chips with another brand or something, they were very basic. Apart from that it's been great! :)"
5,Coming here 4th time. Tastes better in each time. Love for their food is increasing each time. Ambiance is not that high class but ya taste is what really matters. Staff is well serving.
3,"Hi All,We ordered food from this place.Below is the reviewFood 3/5Would have been much better.Would expect to be better at taste next time"
1,Ordered online and received it on time but the quantity was not at all as expected for the amount paid.. Absolutely disappointed with the service. Never again ordering from this place .. one of the worst.
4,Snacks at affordable prices. Quantity is value for the price we pay. Might get a bit late during evenings. Twisty potato is one of the all time favourites
1,"Food is horrible. Half hearted effort put into the sandwiches. Ordered a chilli cheese sandwich among other things and they were stingy on the cheese, not so stingy on the chillies. Bad combination"
3,"A feeling to explore a new unit, food and taste took me to this unit. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs opposite to masala restaurant, not in the corner - though name mentions to be at the corner l.I had two products suggested by the lady,Nippat MasalaChetty Masala (Bhel)they both were good but lacked to attract my taste buds.Overall very good and courteous staff, they are helpful.Unit was averagely cleaned, could notice spider web on roof.Hole in pocket - 100/ head"
4,"A great Punjabi look and feel place in jayanagar.Ambience : 5/5Has a great theme ambience, providing feel of traditional punjabi dhaba by placing charpais. They have normal seating zone as well for people uncomfortable on charpai.Service : 4/5Was given a prompt service. Can't really judge though since went during a non peak time. If waiters would have been more enthusiastic, would have provided an awesome experience.Food : 4/5Food was good, not really great though. Spices were well blend, still a x factor was missing.Veg Friendly: 5/5 it's a vegetarian place, so get all 5 points.Value for money : 4/5 little on more expensive side. Thali is definitely value for money.Visit again : probably yes."
3,"Randomly saw this place in jayanagar n got in . Dabba style seating ..looks colourful . Good staff . Dint like the food much..and over priced . Had the veg cutlets, matar pulao n paneer paratha . Taste can improve to a lot better"
3,We had the veg kabebs which was a little too salty for my liking.The veg kofta was spicy but the veggies were completely mashed which made the kofta very dense.The dry fruit lassi was more like shrikhand and less like lassi but the taste was good.Probably should have tried the batura looked yum.Worth a visit. Ambience is good.
4,A pocket friendly pure veg Punjabi restaurant.. It's a nice place amongst must try places.. Lassies are the best of all here especially the dry fruit lassi.. Among the starters the cheese balls were really good but the Punjabi style French fries didn't click that well. Was a bit disappointed because they told it's going to be spicy but it hardly had any taste to it. The best comes to you when u order the paratas.. Mouth watering ones but too big to finish. The onion aloo combination hit it off.. The dhaba style ambience makes the place interesting and the service was also good. The staff were polite and friendly. But only problem was that we had ask for cutlery everytime.. Should try this place in either of their branches..Food - 4/5Service - 4.5/5Ambience - 4/5
4,"This is a new branch of Kapoor's cafe in jayanagar. It has a ambiance of north villages . dim lights ,charpai and that authentic desi food adds up to the place.Service is quite good. and they can actually handle a crowd of 50-60 people.Food is tasty and has a homely taste.I had few things. started off with a sweet dry fruits lassi.. balanced sweet taste and dry fruits gave the crunchy feel to it.Paneer pakoda was delicious. Deep fried, crispy and flavorfull.a must have finger food.Cheese balls were also good.then we had french fries with the twist it had a tadka of curry leaves giving it a South Indian touch.cheese paratha was good crispy on out side and the cheese inside gave it different flavor.we also had the thali also which had dal makhani, aloo gobhi, paneer lababdar and baigun bharta ... superb taste..in dessert we had fruit ice cream which was also super tasty."
4,"Another pure veg restaurant in Jayanagar, it's a Punjabi restaurant which serves authentic Punjabi food.?

5,"If you guys are looking for some authentic dhaba style food, this is a place to be. Kapoors cafe has now opened its gates in jayanagar right opposite cosmopolitan club.Dry fruit Lassi :- served in a mud pot, this drink is on a heavier side, authentic, rich and thick.Masala Coke : was yummy, ordered twice had chatpata desi flavoursFrench fries : amazing spicy fries with a punjabi twistCheese balls : the cheesy stuffed balls were oozy and drippy a must try for cheese lovers!We happened to try few of the main courses, i was in love with their cheese burst paratha, they were loaded with cheese between the paratha and tasted heavenly.Dal makhani : One of my favourites here, authentic!Paneer do pyaza : flavours could have been better, needed a bit more marination.Verdict:Ambience 5/5Food 4.5/5Service 5/5They need to do something for the parking space, as it is had to find because of the busy road!Will surely visit again to try more!!"
4,"Kapoor's cafe newly opened in Jayanagar, serves the good vegetarian food. This is a pure vegetarian dhaba type restaurant.STARTERS ::Lassi :- Very thick, very rich in texture with generous amount of dry fruits. Had this two kullad, coz I'm a lassi person.1) Masala papad :- Topped with full of tomatoes and onions, but tasted salty definitely not for me.2) Cheese balls :- Stuffed with huge amount of cheese and fried and again felt salty.3) Cheese paratha :- Cheese and tomato stuffed inside paratha, topped with butter. This was too good, believe me having this one will fill your stomach.4) Ghee pulkha with Dal makhni, gobi aloo was superb. The pulkha was very soft and dal makhni a rich gravy the way it should be.Fruit cream ::- A rich cream with chopped fruits and nuts.Perfect to end the meal.Ambience is good, cost is worth."
4,"Kapoor's Cafe has already been synonymous in Bengaluru when it comes to authentic veg food. This branch of restaurant which opened up in Jayanagar has a great ambiance. The lights, the charpai, the synthetic grass below; everything sum upto an exquisite feeling of eating in a modern dhaba.Coming to the service part, it's really amazing. One of the most friendliest staff members I've ever come across in Bengaluru. They were really cooperative and friendly.We had ordered Lassi, French Fries, Cheese Pops, Cheese Paratha and some other dishes. The food was good and fresh.In a nutshell, Kapoor's Cafe treated us like family, which is rare in any other cafe or restaurant.Ambience- 5/5Food- 3.5/5Service- 5/5OVERALL- 4/5Would definitely like to visit this place again."
4,"Kapoor's cafe needs no introduction! They have come up with this new branch in another heart of namma Bengaluru. It has Punjabi theme with khat seats. While sitting here you could enjoy the Punjab delicacies with Punjabi/Bollywood songs.Their dry fruit lassi is actually overloaded with dry fruits, so if you like that do try it. If you are visiting here do not keep dieting in your mind, as they actually flow butter/Chesse on your items. I tried their cheesey bites & 6 layered Chesse paratha. Both of these items were delight to eat and literally dripping Chesse. I also took panner pakoda but sadly that was slightly dry and plain in taste.In the main course, I loved their Ghee Phulkas and Dal Makhni. Even Baigan ka Bharta was delicious too.I was blown away with the hospitality and love to see it again on my next visit."
5,"Kapoor's Cafe, Jayanagar, Bangalore.A brand in its own when it comes to Punjabi food. A complete Veg North Indian restaurant to get the zest of Punjab..This newly opened restaurant is on the top floor, having seating in the form of cots decorated with colourful pillows.Punjabi music being played all the time..I had the following at this place:- Dry Fruit Lassi - Just wow - Must Try- Masala Papad Roasted- Masala Coke- Cheese Pataka Balls - Must Try- French Fries Punjabi style- Cheese Burst Parantha - Oozing cheese with every bite, this one is heavy and must try..Ended this evening with some Bhangra, Paan and good experience..This place is Recommended !.With LoveThetechnifoodie"
3,"Good biriyani place at heart of the layout, quality and ambience are just ok. Quantity is more than sufficient for one. Offers Ambur and Hyderabadi flavours"
4,"The food quality and quantity is good.Service is quick and a hygenic restaurant too.I ordered one curd rice . It was a mixture of veggies and curry leaves , a good taste indeed.Price is pocket friendlyOverall good experiencemy21.food.blog"
3,"The food is ok! The service is quick but the taste is average. It has been an oldie in Jayanagar and staying in Jayanagar for all my life, the taste of food here is no more up to the mark! Their signature Pav Bhaji doesn taste like it used to and i think its a let down.."
4,Best place to grab a quick breakfast or have a nice meal with family or friends. The food is all made fresh and very hygienic. They have the self service counter in the groundfloor and seating arrangement for the first floor.
4,Samosas were crispy and tasty please give correct description Maggi as Maggi donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât misguide the customer I was expecting noodles but received Maggi

5,"If it wasn't SMV, jain college life would have been incomplete, cheese maggi, paneer roll, oreo milk shake and many more helped us survive at that place, and most importantly never expected SMV to be on ZOMATO... Do try out at this place"

4,Too good for the best Andhra meals which is unlimited and service is also good enough ambience is not that great ??it Would have been better if it was more of vegetarian menu.
4,Wanted to try this place from so many days and finally we had been here for dinner with family .It was quite amazing and well organised for the family dinner we had a very gud experience.The food was good with more spicy and it was well served .
5,"Good ambience with perfect candle lights on your table? ordered chicken kebab- juicy and tasty, Guntur chicken- Yummmmmm is the word, and Amaravathi chicken dry- very tasty, along with mocktails- which tasted perfect with the food, and a family pack chicken biriyani- easily serves 5 and was wonderful. Had gone with no expectations, but it was an yummy in my tummy experience ? thanks team."
5,"This hotel welcomes with good ambience. It's a part of presidency hotel.It has good hygiene with authentic Andhra cuisine.It serves one of the best chilli chicken and chicken biryani,we just loved it. They also serve good portions. The service by Mr. Souresh was great, was taken good care of by him. We also had Murgh ghee roast, it was great.Not to forget the guava ice cream, which was served with a pinch of salt and chilli powder on it.It tasted just like the fruit guava. It's a must try. Overall a good experience."
4,"Superb Food..Veg Meals was Outstanding..Biriyani was out if this world and mutton dry, Royal seems chicken were superb. Huge place with good staff and quick service. A very nice Experience worth going again and again."
4,Giving a 4 rating just for the mutton biryani which was tasty. Their meals were not up to mark. Dal pappu was a bit spicy. Nothing really special about the veg meals esp for the price. The guava ice cream with chilli powder is tasty and something refreshing at the end of a meal.
4,"This place has Authentic Andhra food , quantity and the quality of the food is really nice, biryanis here are the best , mutton briyani is a must try and Andhra ruchulu chicken was yummy. They have a option of family briyani which will serve 5 to 6 people at Lower price!! Starters and coolers , main dish everything was good even the sea food is good. Only disappointment was with Chinese it could have been better , other than that this place wins !!"
3,Food here is good I had andhara meals which had a lot of items . Staffs were friendly and kind. They have a lot of other good options for Indian food .
5,"This restaurant located next to Kalyan jewellers and situated in Jayanagar 3rd block, here we get authentic Andra style food ? service is very good ? food is delicious ? ambience was quite decent ? here we get perfect Andra spicy food ? staff is so friendly ? I like the sitting arrangements over here ?"
4,They serve some amazing chaats. Samosas n kachoris are fried in pure ghee. Very tasty and fresh snacks. Must try the unique samosa sandwich.
4,WiFi:NoFriendly staff:7/10Price:Pocket friendlyTaste-o-meter:8/10Ordered for:Dahi puri:We have seen chaats that are served with puri are kind of round in shape but here the puri is in a boat or oval shape.This is something different and the taste is also different from the other outlets.Rasgulla:I loved their rasgulla the size is also big and the taste was really yummy.Vada pav:The vada pav that is been served here fills a person's stomach as the size is also big and the taste is also good and it's worth buying.Papdi chaat:Papdi chaat was served with flat puris and with curds and some pomegranates I had not tasted anything like this before.!Must try:Chaats are really yummy
4,"We heard about this cafe from my colleague and since then planned on visiting. It is very close to VV Puram eat street. Ambience on this place is good. It's not that well ventilated but place is big enough that we do not suffocate. Shesha is amazing they have good variety of flavour and different base,chillum. Coming to food we ordered chilly panner which was expectionaly good. Arrabiata pasta was creamy and light. Jalapeno popper were mouth watering. Crispy chilly potato was spicy and crispy worthy of the name. Rocher milkshakes were just heavenly the thick shake with dense chocolate flavour made our day. The staff was generous enough to offer us a complimentary ice cream, quality of the ice cream was excellent it was creamy light and perfect balance of sweet. We would definitely recommend it."
4,"Good food,quick service,good amnience what else do you need in a restaurant. I really like the food over her I took a panner manchurian,mushroom 65 and a baby corn pepper dry and Malawi kofta with butter kulcha and a lime soda everything tasted really good and I liked it a lot.this is a good place to visit with your family.But the only problem is it is tough to get parking, I would definetly recommend this place"
5,Rajathadri food fort is the Best hotel I ever come across in Bangalore.Best taste.Best ambiance.Reasonable price.It is situated in nice place.Totally loved it.
4,"If u stay in Jayanagar and you want to visit a good place for dinner whether you want to have North Indian , South Indian , chats or just pav bhaji, I would blindly suggest you rajathadri . They got good food to satisfy ur hunger . No doubt you can take ur friends or family too . They have two sections . A section for self service and if youÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâre lucky u can get a table to sit too or otherwise it doesnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât harm to stand at a food table and just eat . They also have service hall . But sometimes you might need to wait ."
3,"Being close to where we live we often visit here for coffee, and breakfast. They have two dining areas, one where you go for a quick bite which is a self service area. The other is a service area. We were 8 of us and went to the service area for lunch on a weekday. We got a table immediately. The decor is quite simple and nothing commendable. The staff were friendly and always smiling.We had masala papad which chatpata and tasty. The baby corn Manchurian was crisp and not heavily spiced. I did not relish the tomato soup as it was too tangy and oily. Then we had roti/kulchas, paneer butter masala, kaju masala and veg kadai. The gravys were well made, they had flavour and the paneer was nice and soft. The kulchas were very rubbery which was disappointing. A lot of effort went into finishing those. We had curd rice and ended our meal with gajar ka halwa which was well made.The prices are very moderate and the service is good. Overall a decent place to dine!"
4,One of good vegetarian restaurant that provides umpteen north indian cuisine options . Had been there with family for Sunday lunch and felt happy for making the right choice.Right from the soup to main course was perfectly. Cooked and quantity was great for 7 members . Few dishes was spicy and service is quick.foodpunditbengaluru.wordpress.com
4,Button idly is my choice from the outlet. Combination of button idlies dipped in sambar with ghee topping is something which should not be missed.
4,"The problem with places like this is that everytime the food tastes different.Had parcelled palak Alu last time and it was the most tastiest veg dish ever. And when I tried palak mushroom last week, I was breathing fire. And they do not know how to do Mangalore bajji. What they serve is a insult to the original dish ?On the whole, good place for family to sit and enjoy a relaxed time. Ambience is good. Try the palak marsala dosa.....its yummy"
2,"For breakfast i been here many times? here breakfast is too good like : masala dosa, rice bath , kichidi , khara bath is very good ? as usual coffee and tea? well maintained place, good service and decent ambience.. finally I been for lunch, we took south and north Indian Thali options are not that great and tastwise also , south Thali was ok ok but north Indian Thalia all items taste like tamarind taste , no vegetables in sabz , veg biryani was not good, I liked only Dal? very disappointing"
3,Overrated place with costly pricing. Service a bit late. Hot chocolate fudge wasn't hot at all. Taste is okay. Can try once if no nice eatery is available.
3,Located is tbe centre of Jaynagar. Big enough. It has service hall as well as fast cood counter. Road side Parking. Idly and Sambhar was very nice. Piping hot yummy Sambhar and good chutney. Cheese Dosa was very average. Batter had become sour.Hopefully will try again.Cleanliness was maintained well.
4,One of the oldest restaurant in Basavanagudi which serves amazing dosa and idli sambar...people do hangout here after their everyday routine walk in Lalbagh or Krishna Rao park to have coffee and lipsmacking idli sambar..
4,"Nice place near Basavanagudi, worth trying all the items , Dosa and vada is too good , any item is good it is always filled with people , coffee is goodAmbience:3.5/5Food:4/5"
5,"Located in Basvangudi and is a perfect place for a simple yet tasty breakfast.Best filter coffee and idly,vada!Their sambar is just delicious!I wouldn't recommenced the masala dosa....The bisi bele bath here is really good!The price was very reasonable. Highly recommended for a good sunday breakfast."
4,"SLV is probably the only place that serves a chutney dip. I went there with my cousins on a Sunday morning. It was packed to the brim with people which was a really good sign. We were soon seated and we ordered poori, masala dosa, idly chutney dip, idly sambhar dip, vada and vada with sambhar dip.The ambience is pretty basic like a darshini style. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs properly ventilated and quite a few people can be seated at a time. The service is quick and courteous.The poori was fluffy and not oily. It tasted really good with the saagu and chutney. The masala dosa was pretty standard. If you like very crisp dosas, youÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâll like this. The idly chutney dip was delectable. The chutney was refreshing with the flavour of coriander and coconut.What I didnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât quite fancy was the coffee and tea. Both of them were very strong and even my cousins felt so.Overall, a nice breakfast joint to go with your family.Food- 3.5/5Service- 4/5Value for money- 4.5/5"
2,"While I've tried this place in the past, wanted to try it again. Went here this morning n had rava idly. First things first. The prices on the menu is slightly on the higher side for a darshini type of hotel. Idly costs 28/-, rava idly cost me 32/-. This is no brahmins coffee hotel in chamrajpet. Nevertheless coming to the food, it certainly isn't the best. Chutney was salty n sagu was bearable. Rava idly is just about average n nothing much to rave about. Would you regret if you miss this place? Most likely A BIG NO. If I can come this far, another half a kilometer ahead, I would rather go to brahmins coffee hotel. Though the price is high, they compensate with good food. Nevertheless another ""no more visit to this hotel"" in my book."
4,"Food : 4/5 || Ambience : 3/5 || Value for money : 4/5|| Service : 4/5Located at the heart of Basavanagudi, has one of the best Masala Dose.Vada + Sambhar (dip) is one of my personal favourite.The sambhar is full flavoured and crispy vada tastes delicious.Everything from Rava Idly to Coffee is satisfactory.Recommendations : High"
4,"Food- 4/5Service - 4/5Ambience- 3/5Masala dosa, vada sambhar, idly, and other breakfast items are really good here. Loved the chutney as it had perfect consistency and spice.Will visit again for sure."

At the end of the day , it is taste n quality with d most reasonable price ?had to tell thanks to this restaurant .."
3.5,I had ordered fish meal. I felt curry was too much tangy. Fish was okay. Rice was provided too much in quantity since I felt curry was tangy couldn't finish it.
4,"Randmly tried ordering food , was delicious and worth the price , should definitely try to satisfy ur taste buds...the delivery was real quick as well."
4,So I accidentally stumbled upon this place on Swiggy when I was thinking of ordering something and decided to taste the food. The Biriyani was the typical South Indian Donne Biriyani with ample chicken with it. The Chicken 65 was soft and satisfied the taste buds. It's a no frills place and value for money place for non veg appetite.
4,I love this Resturant. Though lil expensive taste and quality is nice. Love their chaats as well north indian.Most of the time been for south indian breakfast. Dosas are yummy. Spring dosa is awesome.Cutlery is good. Neat and hygenic. Staff is good..service is done well.
3,It is a clean and tidy restaurant in this area. You will have to face long lines before you can find a table for yourself. Taste wise I would say average. Professional wise very high. Not really worth the quality of food they offer.
4,A pretty decent veg friendly restaurant in banashankari . It has a lot of varieties with a great menu. Ambience is great and Staff is very friendly. Do try out to have a good dining experience.
3,"Krishna Grand is a fine dining restaurant located in Banashankari. It's mainly known for its South Indian meals. The place is usually very crowded, so make sure you take the necessary measures of you happen to go during the peak hours. It's a pure vegetarian restaurant.I've had the North Indian and South Indian food on many occasions. It's decent. The South Indian meals are definitely worth the price, while the North Indian food is slightly over priced, especially for an area like Banashankari which is a residential locality. The chats however are very good. Had the cutlet, masala puri and pani puri. It was yumm!"
5,"Krishna Grand is the place for authentic south India breakfast. Must try is their signature combo, this includes small portions of karabath, kesribath, Button idly in sambar dip, button idly in chutney dip, button idly sprinkled with gun powder (Guntur idly), wada, small masala dosa, 3 varieties of chutney and either Pongal or dhai Wada and coffee/tea. This combo is paisa vasool. Good quality and quantity food."
3,"Nice food, specially Bonda soup, the price is pretty high though. The Thali is pretty filing, it's a bit costly ,the juices are good, sweets are ok, the ambience is simple, Saturday Sunday u need to book the tables ... Or else I will end up standing in a long queue"
4,"A ""must visit "" south Indian restaurant. Usually very crowded in the weekends for breakfast. I was lucky when I visited, as I got a seat immediately. Try button idly, vada.. I liked the interiors too."
3,The food was average! The quantity was good but the taste dint match up to the hype the restauarant had created! I had ordered chilly paneer as a part of my order and i was surprised to find chilly paneer with Elaichi!
2,"I've ordered from here quite a few times and the food was average. Nothing to write home about. But last night, I ordered a tomato basil soup and tandoori Gobi.I have to write about this!Soup was watery - like slightly spicy, red water.Gobi- the reason I order tandoori dishes is because of the flavor. It has generally less or minimal oil as it's cooked in a clay oven. But this one was - full of oil and so very red. Clearly, lot of color. The only 2 things dominating I'm this dish was the color and floating oil. I missed capturing a pic but I'm adding the pic of the box with oil after taking the Gobi pieces out. Now the accompaniment- mint chutney. Guess what, it was - yes you got that right - so green! Again, full of color. I added twice the amount of curd just to make it palatable.2 is also a bit high for that dish."
3,"A pretty big, well known place for breakfast set up in Banashankari. Good variety of items, south and north indian cuisines. Absolutely love the rava onion dosa, very tasty. Quite expensive though."
3,Pretty decent ambience. No complains about the food. I felt the pricing is a bit on the higher side. The place Can be maintained much better.
4,This is the main streets of Basavangudi Gandhi Bazaar.Always crowded and fast service. Nice food.Priced properly. Service is quick.North south chinese available too. Like their gravies and chaats.Been for south Indian breakfast too. A good place.
4,Taste is good and ambience is fine. But I observed a bit late service from the staff as well as the seats/tables are very much near to each other. I feel congested somewhat.
3,Roti Ghar is good for vegetarians small and sweet to have a good lunch or dinner with family and friends service interior nice food taste of delivery is good
3,Ordered a paneer tikka manchurian and crispy veg. Quality of food not up to mark. Paneer wasnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât fresh. No proper taste in the crispy veg. They even added batter fried beans into the crispy veg. Was weird.
4,"Colleagues and friends planned lunch here which was a 30 minutes drive and the whole affair was an 1.5 hours getaway from intense meetings. Loved the food here and the price is just unbelievable. Having stayed in NCR it's pretty hard to see a proper Kannadiga cuisine layout. The Puran poli served first was a meal in itself. The ghee roast Mysore masala dosa was multiple notches higher in standard than the ones I have tried so far. Puliyaogare and curd rice were one of the best I have tried so far. They also served a come of our choice of ice cream as dessert. All for 150 bucks, an 8 course meal !!!! Going to come back for more for sure..."
4,Awesome old place in Basavanagudi and love their dosa and mallige idli..coffee is really good..ambiance and service and hospitality needs to be improved..
3,Food was okay okay but this place will be always busy with people and at ground floor it self service and at 1st floor you can find seating was quite cleanService was okFood taste - 3/5
4,I recently been here which is after 10 years!!When I was in btech college I used to come a lot here! But in todayÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs busy life and Bangalore traffic itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs difficult to travel in Blore ?One of the best place for North Indian food. They give taste quality and quantity for reasonable price! Which is very rare!I had ordered buttermilk which was for 30 bucks! I felt itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs expensive but when I got my order I was shocked to see buttermilk was worth more than 30 bucks for itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs quality quantity and taste!!One must try roti paneer combo and manchurians !!
4,"Good soup, nice starters.. panner chilly, pepper fried corn are good.. All the items tastes awesome.. good variety of curries in main course.. table booking is recommended on weekends.."
3,Taste - 3/5Staff - FriendlyAmbiance - Very BusyReally nice and pocket friendly option. The food tastes just as good as it is on the pocket. The rice and chats are nice and so are the dosas.It tends to be crowded most of the time due to it's popularity to the masses. Dining also is an option other than self service and that too is really nice
5,Visited here after years and still the taste is the same and their quality of food too is amazing! Always a must visit when in Basavanagudi! I always take their roti curry combo which is worth and will fill your stomach!
5,"This is the best place to have food , we get all varieties of food like North Indian , South Indian ,chats ,juice , ice cream this is located in gandi bazar this place is crowded all the time it as self service as well as dinning area .Must have food was fried rice and ice creams"
3,"The food was served fast and it was yum: Paneer Manchurian, Veg Kofta, Veg Sweet Corn, Butter Kulcha. ?The ambiance howerver was horried so dim that you could not read the menu ? and felt like a local bar ?. They really need to use a different colour.And the staff need to be told to stop staring when you are eating as it's very irrtating.Overall the place has good food, @Management has to consider the lighting and staff. And because of this the 3 rating."
4,"Food - 4/5Ambience - 3.5/5Service - 3/5Easily the best cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå© in the neighborhood and possibly the only one not including the CCD's that you find at the end of every road.Appears to be a popular place for smokers to chill at, as the smoking area looks very quaint and comfortable.I would recommend their pancakes with chocolate syrup and ice cream which I've enjoyed everytime I've been there."
4,"The Coffee Shack is one of the lesser known, but cozy places in BSK 3rd Stage. It's located just a few hundred meters from PESIT on Outer Ring Road.? Standout Features of The Coffee Shack:??Nice ambience??Not too crowded??Good pricingThe food is quite good and service is very good. Since it's not too crowded, this is a good place to catch up with friends for a long conversation.I've been here on multiple occasions and haven't been disappointed any time. Some dishes need to - of course improve, for example the Nachos which are served with cheesy sauce all over - making it completely soggy.Star Factor:Ambience: ????Service: ????1/2Food: ???1/2Quality: ???1/2Presentation: ????"
2,"Though the presentation of the place and food looked good, nothing that i ordered tasted good here. For starters, though the name says Coffee Shack, there is hardly any coffee options. The masala tea was machine brewed, the hot chocolate tasted like watery bournvita milk amd the garlic bread was very salty.The management has to put in extra efforts to deliver good food."
4,"Cozy place with good varieties. Been for a weekend brunch. Thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes. Masala Maggie, scrambled eggs, pasta all were up to the mark. Quite highly priced though."
5,"The food was amazing, the chicken barbecue literally gave me a foodgasm, the nachos were also good, the chicken and spaghetti was yummy.The desserts might need a little bit more attention especially their choco fantasy brownie(it was a bit overpriced) but otherwise it was a memorable experience."
4,"I had read good reviews about this place, so we decided to try it out yesterday.My order-1. JalapeÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå±o cheese balls-Yummmyyyyy. And good quantity for 2 people too.Very good cheese filling on the inside and crispyness on the outside.A must-try starter.2. Veg Alfredo Pasta-The sauce smelled incredible, and the pasta tasted even better. Everything was cooked to perfection, with right amount of cheese and vegetables.My favorite dish of my order.3. Virgin Mojito-Refreshing drink.4. Smokey Chicken Burger-It tasted good, but not great. The patty couldÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâve had little less meat. IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâd rate it 7/10.Overall, the place had ample seating area, and courteous staff.I had a great time here, and IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâd recommend it to all. ??"
3,"Cozy and comfy place located in hoskerehalli near banashankari 2nd stage. Easily identifiable as it is located in the busy main road.Food:1)veg paneer pizza which is of thin crust. Tasted very dry and wasn't hot.2)twistato was tasteful. Where two pieces are served in a plate with tomato and mayo sauce.3)virgin mojito was refreshing in the end.Service:Was quiet quick and staff people were friendly.Ambience: Outdoor seating available with plants around you. But it seemed to be like a smoking zone.When you enter inside,it's quiet spacious with many seatings and books around you with all photos on the walls related to food.There is one more section if you go inside,where screening is available."
4,"It's one of the few good Cafe's in Banshakari.If you wanna just chill and play some board game with your friends,this is literally your go to place?The food is amazing too(savoury crepes are must try)Coming to the ambience,it has really good interiors and very very calm place to study too!The staff is very friendly and the service is good"
4,"Nice place for coffee and just chilling out with friends. The price is justified for the quantity and quality of food. We tried Caramel latte, naughty choco jar and nutella banana shake."
4,"Visited this place on a Friday evening...very relaxing ambience for both smokers and non-smokers with various board games. Had ordered corn cheese balls, garlic bread ,green apple juice ,spinach corn savory crepes, french ratatouille with rice. All the food delivered were hot and yummy. You can take one corner in restaurant and enjoy food with uno..ludo ..chess .. snake ladder. Overall a weekend well started ."
4,"A cosy walk in into a enjoyable time with amazing food. It's on the main road and is not difficult to spot.They don't delay in serving except for first 10 minutes then u get food all at a shot (uncool, Caz we asked them to serve our later) but we forgot everything once our buds touched the feast.The really cheesy fries, Aribiatta pasta, and the sandwich, were AAmazingg. The food here is not disappointing, n you find good variety.Not over priced either, since it's a new opening.They have a separate area for smoking, normal dining and an air conditioned room, choice is yours.Peaceful for business talks or studies.Food - 4.5/5Ambience - 4/5Price - 4.5/5Service - 3.5/5Recommended for any meal, peaceful and in budget food."
2,"The tea was amazing...damn i was literally surprised by the flavour of tea, the tea i felt was prepared individually with optimum tea leaves not like the other local teas i have tatsted with heavy tea leaves which usually left me with a sore stomach after that and then the lemon grass punch was refreshing, the worst part was it's pancakes, first of all the size will disappoint you and if it's full for your stomach then the price will disappoint for sure the reason was that the pancakes were too hard and it didn't even feel buttered so on a whole pancake was literally a disappointment for me.Now i would like to add something, going by this lemongrass flavoured tea now i would literally like to have green tea or chamomile tea prepared from your kitchen, thank you ? looking forward for your chamomile tea first."

3,tea had become Cold
4.5,It was simply yum! I ordered it being lazy to get up for breakfast. Didn't expect it to be good. The delivery was fast and the taste made my day.
5,This is a cute small place serving good food at a very reasonable price. My all time favourite is their paneer satay. The quantity is too too much but i am defintnot complaining!!????
4,"Amazing place for North Indian food specially punjabi food .Although not very spacious and clean but the food here is really good .I ordered for paratha thali and it had two tandoori aloo parathas with black Channa, pickle and Raitha and everything tasted good :"
4,Nice place to enjoy authentic Punjabi meal. They have nice dishes of Punjabi and even it somewhere match the taste of Punjab also ...good staff service and budget price
4,What do we say about paneer satay! They are the best thing you will ever have in your day!Their thali is filling and the service is too good. The place is small and cozy. Paneer dishes and the jain dishes steal the show here!Great Work Team!
4,"Visited this place today for a quick lunch while shopping at Gandhi Bazar. The ambience is amazing and we chose a seating area next to the French window. I ordered the Amritsari kulcha thali going by the waitstaff's suggestion. Asked him to add butter cubes to the kulcha as it's yum to have them moist. It was served with chole, thick curd, onions, pickle, lemon slices and mint chutney. It was so filling and I had to order a sweet lime soda to digest all of that :D I'm skipping Dinner for sure! Must visit place for a good Punjabi cuisine experience."
5,"Brilliant sweets, samosa and kachori made the authentic north Indian way. You cannot go wrong with the snacks here. The chutney is also superb. We ate one of everything and the bill was minimal. Really need to find a place like this in North Bangalore, so if you know of one, please comment and let me know!"
4,"Poonam sweets is famous for kachori, jalebi and other sweets it is one of the famous sweet shops in BDA complex I have been visiting here for 5 years"
4,"Located inside BDA Complex in BSK, Poonam Sweets has for long been renowned for their delightful Samosa, Kachori, Dhokla, Jalebi, Basundi, Badam Milk and other sweets.Most of these are made multiple times in a day, you'll be able to get freshly made, piping hot savories if you wait for a few minutes as most batches get immediately sold out during the evenings.Prices are extremely affordable and taste is excellent. They could improve upon the hygiene though. Do give this place a try when you're in BSK."
3,"Food - 3/5Ambience - 2/5Service - 3/5Must Try - Jalebi.Clue - Tasty and popular as no other in Banashankari vicinity. Although it is a value for money, maybe quality and cleanliness can definitely be raised up."
5,"Best place in South bangalore for amazing kachori,samosa,Randi,jalebi,dhokla and what not! The freshly made super hot savouries will make you go Gaga! I can have them at any time of the day and never get bored! Do rush to this place right away if you haven't visited it yet!"
4,"The best cake I have ever had, they make it fresh we just need to order it 1 hour early but it is a bit soggy though because they cool it as soon as it comes out of the oven."
5,prompt delivery
5,"Mouth watering Mysore pak is the best followed by kaju katli, kalakand,radagulla ,goolab jamoon ,ghee jalebi,dry fruits ....worth every rupee"
4,excellent service
1,"I receive spoiled sweet and I will never buy any thing again, I am waiting to return the box, this online kanti sweet is wrost and they are spoiling the brand name."
1,Sweet quality not good
1,Very bad customer service. Not accepting swiggy order saying they have 50 customers in line. They don't want to even talk to the customer and say sorry to have the order cancelled.
5,Great taste and hygiene food.loved the mini rasagullas and kaju sweets.....would definitely recommend to everyone...... overall a nice experience
1,"#Zomoto still failed to keep there standards and delay in live chat, after making online payment immediately order confirmed by restaurant #kantisweets without seeing stocks are available or not. Seriously they fucked me you by responding me after 1.30hr by saying items are not available and cancelled order."
2,"Guys don't ever try their Bombay Halwa. It's highly elastic/ rubbery, they charged me 58 Rs for 2 pcs. It really sucks..I have called up the store and unfortunately, they say it's their speciality."
3,always they replace the items. this time I got same items twice.
1,Mixture quality was very bad. I think it's old stock. It smells bad. I had to throw in dust bin. It's waste of money. If I eat stomach will upset. Be careful these people are selling bad quality if order online. Don't support this kind of business.
3,Whenever we order through online the Snacks it will take the order but after they will confirming no snacks are not available. It's so disappointed
4,"Kanti is my go to sweet shop most of the times. Taste & quality is their trademark. However they sometimes miss to fulfill the deliveries. I wish them not to forget the online customers, if they want to lead in the market."
5,fast delivery
1,I didn't get the food what I ordered.
4,"Kanti sweets is quite famous shop.They offer variety of sweets.I Had ordered mini rasgulla, mini jamoon and benne murukku from this outlet.Jamoon was excellent and rasgulla was ok. Benne murukku was the best among the three.Definitely looking forward to order more items fill here."

5,gud
5,Excellent quality. Great Taste. Timely service.
4,"I love Special Mysore Pak, Malai Cham Cham and Kaju Barfi the most at Kanti Sweets. Snacks also are very delightful to taste, especially their Samosa and Kachori.However Kanti Sweets is somewhat over priced."
3,over sweet

4,sweets are fresh and yummy. Not satisfied with badam halwa
5,tasty food
5,Kaaju katli is just awesome. And the best place to purchase Bengali sweets.. and rasmali sweet available here is amazing... Must try sweets are here
4,Located on a busy four way road of Srinivasanagar..this establishment is a sole provider of good quality sweets. I love the angoori gulab jamoon and angoori petha. Petha is the best one of all sweets.Quality: 4/5Location: 4/5Variety of sweets: 4/5Staff mannerism: 5/5
3.5,Its close by and one of the big names in the sweet mart industry. Smallish outlet. Good for the odd Kachori craving. Sweets are good too Kaju roll and sohan halwa. They make a decent bhel puri too.
4,"Love this place for delicious sweets. I am fond of sweets, a natural feature for a north Indian :)You get some good tasty sweets, but range of items is not so great. I wish they get more items on their shelves."
5,I love Kanti sweets:-) its best is Khaju barfi
4,"Polar bear! Death by chocolate. That just pop's up in my mind when I hear polar bear. But this time I ended up not eating death by chocolate and everything else. The person serving here was really nice and polite that he let me taste all the flavours. Woah! Such a flavour blast!! Pretty Nice ambiance, which was hygienic too. Well maintained."
2.5,"Had been to grab a quick dessert but was disappointed ? with taste and quantity. We had ordered for Chocolate fudge which went for a toss. Did not enjoy really the taste was not good. The ice cream melted in just two minutes and we had been here on a chilly evening. also we ordered Coke Float, which actually was not more than three sips. What we paid was not worth it . Can tell that the Polar Bear is not maintaining the taste consistently."
2,"Pretty disappointed with the ice cream which was delivered.I had ordered for a hot chocolate fudge sundae but instead all I got was butterscotch with a bit of chocolate syrup. To add to it, the ice cream was melted and also of small quantity. My first experience from this place wasn't a good one."
3,"The usual small place, with good tasting ice cream.it looks really dirty almost all the time I have visited it n it's really off putting. I hope they tidy up soon. r I'm not going!"
1,"I dont know if anyone has experienced this but I took Moti-chur Pak/Burfi to mangalore and handed it over to my relatives. They ate it the next day. So 2 elapsed days from me buying to the consumption. They said 2-3 pieces were spoiled. I had also taken Kaju Katli and some roasted almond and channa burfi (which was quite good and different), luckily these turned out to be ok. Sometime back I had taken some of these sweets on a trip to Ireland and again within the span of 2 days I found they were changing taste.My assumption was that quite a lot of people frequent this shop and hence there wont be any stale sweets - but these experiences I have had are turning out to be the contrary. Shame on you guys."
4.5,"Very clean and neat place. The food is stored and served in hygenic environment and staff are well trained as well.The taste of sweets are really good and they maintain the same standards across the stores.They do serve chaats here at Bsk but they are generally quite sweet as well.Love the Dhai balla , katori chat and Dhai Puri.Priced slightly higher than your avg sweet shop the quality and taste justifies the pricing.Sweets like Kaju Katli are priced about 930/kg.Packing is premium as well.Good sweets , clean ambience and good service."
1,"Went to this shop in the afternoon around 1:40 and could immediately see flies in the first section of sweets as soon as you enter. Then I realized there was a dead fly in the motichoor ladoo and took a picture which I have uploaded. When I told the staff about it, he just threw that piece away! I don't think I would ever risk buying sweets from this place ever!!!"
3.5,"The sweets are pretty good here, If not the best.The shop looks Hygienic & cool.The chats were not that great.Overall, The shop is on the right path."
5,This place has always been a heaven for sweet lovers. They are the best north indian sweet makers. Have an excellent variety of sweets. They are always fresh and if case they are spoiled for some reason the store will not sell it. Quality is assured. A must recommended place
3.5,"Anand Sweets is a well known name in Bangalore. Lots of sweets and snacks. Really nice taste, hygienic and premium verities. Rasmali is a must have. Their Dhoklas are also very nice."
3.5,"The quality of sweets is very good. However most of the items are over priced. Love the Kachoris, the chaats, and dhokla here. The rasmalai is good too. The Kachori chaat with added dahi is one of the best items I have had here.They refuse to give dahi with the plain kachori insisting that dahi comes only with the chaat items. I wish they serve kachoris with optional curd and not only with chutneys."
3.5,"I go very often to Anand Sweets, since there are very good sweet shops around this vicinity. However, some of the sweets are unmatchable over here. I usually prefer going to Anand Sweets for some special occasions at home. The Anand Sweets near BDA Complex is well maintained with good dÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå©cor. I just love their Chaats like Samosa Chat, Dahi Puri and Bhel Puri because of typical north indian flavor. Prices are higher end and may be double compare to other sweet shops. I will recommend this place!bangaloreepicure.com"
4,Always loves Anand Sweets.Took Motichor laddoo and Mixture.Tried other sweets from other outlets. Taste is very good.Both were very good.Cost is reasonable.Nice packing.Service is also good.
3,"Sweets are costly , the staff are lazy , but very nice for evening snacks mixed variety of dishes are available please do not go on odd times ."
3.5,Another nice Sweets and Chats place. But with something new to offer..  Has slightly authentic Delhi chat flavours to it..The sweet gullas are also decent.. Another favourite of my kids..
4,"Super excited to have the delicious varieties of chaats,sweets and namkeen now available in banshankri, just opposite BDA complex(on the same road as gelato/polar bear/itsy bitsy). My personal favourite would be the lassi,badam milk,rasmalai ,rasgulla, papdi chaat, dahi bhalla, dahi puri and almost all the other Bengali sweets. Absolutely delicious!Cons: there is no place to sit at all. You'd have to eat your chaat standing. More suitable for takeaways."
4,"""Sweets"" everyone's favourite!!! Just don't feel like getting out of this place cuz everything looks so delicious! Tried almost every sweet here, motichoor laddu stands at the peak, it almost melts as soon as one puts it in the mouth! Rasgullas and jamoons are to die for!"
3.5,"They closed down the first floor service section... I really loved the chole batura...n the badam,milkHopefully they start all their food items service all over again"
4,Very gud taste..service is gud...nice place to hangout...
4,"Good place, really nice overall. Good ice cream and amazing toppings (which are of your choice) they charge you by the weight of the ice cream you've taken. Will visit again soon."
4.5,"I have visited this place many times and is frequent hangout place. They have got lots of varieties in their menu and serve quickly when order is given. From juices to ice creams sundaes, they have everything which includes different energetic drinks and also caters to the needs of health conscious people."
3.5,"Good place for fresh fruit juice and some shakes and ice creams too. We tried their gadbad, death by chocolate and watermelon juice. All good. Not a place for those looking for ambience and seating. Quick grab and go type of place."
3.5,"All the juices here taste fresh, & The Ice creams are SUPER CHEAP & great for that price.Seating area is pretty Bad, But if you don't have a problem with sitting on stools,It won't be a problem.Service is fast ,But avoid the sandwiches here."
4.5,Amazing place to have lassis. Best in town maybe. Dry fruit lassi was amazing. Kaju anjeer milkshake was too good. Service was great. Loved this place. :)
4,Taste it n knw it!!!!!! Cool place for gymmers... dry fuit n pista banana milkshakes r outstanding ones.. everytng here is Good.. dis place is always crowded..
3,Juice park is the most commonly used name for this lassi & Ice cream joint.Folks here are doing a great job by building good rapport with customers and trust me taste is good though.Fresh Fruit juices and Ice creams are really nice with affordable pricing.They have to concentrate bit on hygiene prospect.I use to visit quite often during my bachelor days for Juices & Lassi's.Overall:Quality: 3.25/5Taste: 3/5Service: 3.25/5Hygiene: 2.75/5bangaloreepicure.com

2,phulka was very bad it tasted like I was eating stone
5,This is a small cafe like place. They serve great burgers and pizzas. Their strawberry milkshake with ice cream ( ask for thick) are simply amazing. Also their burgers are extremely affordable and very tasty. I keep visiting this place often for a quick bite.

1,The ice cream was not delivered in thermally insulated bag. All the ice cream had melted and was in liquids state
5,super deliver guru
3,The place ambiance is good. Few foods r excellent and few foods like pasta nd pizza they hv to improve the taste. If ur buying chats itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs actually very nice here nd felt little budget friendly compared to other places
5,Taste should be really appreciated! Hygienic and unique are the words to express my opinion about CornerStone. one must visit and explore. Really cozy place.

5,"Thank you team Floured,for baking the yummy to taste n visually appealing cake at such a short notice!! All loved the cake n we had a memorable half year birthday of our little girl!!!Would keep coming back to you for more!!!"
5,The cakes have the perfect amount of sweet and light. The red velvet cupcakes are just too good and have the best chocolate cakes.Thank you for the wonderful cupcakes and for my birthday cake
5,"To be honest, I feel Floured is really under rated. Their red velvet cake was the best cake that I had ever eaten! So creamy and just one bite of it and you go like ''mmmmmm?"".Very fresh and so beautiful looking too!! Would totally recommend everybody to try them out. Birthday parties, weddings, events or even just to make yourself feel better, these cakes know their way! ?"
5,"My friends surprised me with red velvet cupcakes from these guys and it was amazing, not too sweet, moist and delicious, just how I like it!Thanks for making my day more special guys! Can't wait to try your other delicacies as well!"
5,Neatly done...grt taste...very moist...and most importantly done as it is said...will definetly recommend...eggless baking with a great taste...it is truly baked with love..
5,The best red velvet cupcakes I have ever eaten. Every bite of it just melts in mouth. And the butter cream frosting is delicious. Both in taste and presentation I give them 10 on 10.NO ONE CAN EAT JUST ONE ?
5,Thanks Keshav and Anita for the lovely birthday cake. It was exactly the same as in the pic that I shared. Cake was delivered intact and on time. All at the party enjoyed the velvety cake. My son thought the dinosaur on top is a real toy. I am sure to think of you guys as the first option while ordering cake for all future occassions
5,The best gift for my mum on her birthday.. Yummy cupcakes with a theme that is close to my mum (a home chef) .. The theme was beautifully shown and also tasted very yummy.. They were very punctual with the delivery as well...
5,The cupcakes were really amazing! The themes were so prominent those skills are really appreciated ! Red velvet especially were too good ! Loved them ?
5,One day my wife said we needed to celebrate our daughter's half year birthday- I said Ok...the search was then on for the perfect cake. We came to know of the couple who run this home style bakery from our relative; the community where they stay have 'Floured' as their regular baker for specialty cakes. They delivered us a red velvet cake with vanilla butter icing with a cute sculpture on top. The cake was moist and the icing made with real butter. It was so good that we saved the leftover for ourselves rather than sharing it with others (which was the actual plan).  It is undoubtedly one of the best I have had till now. A big heartfelt thanks to Anitha and Keshav for the special cake for the special occasion.
4,"When I was looking up for some homemade innovate cakes for my brothers birthday. I found this page on Facebook, I was take by surprise to see cakes which had intricate decorations but made to perfection.It is run by Anitha and Keshav. It's been 8 months and almost for every birthday and marriage of my family I have ordered cakes from here. I have been impressed with the designs and taste.The best cake so far has been chocolate cake with vanilla cream. If you want go with less sugar for cakes or icing/cream they will do it as per requirement. They even delivery it to the required place. Even though it is little costly but surely it is worth every penny.Surely one should order from here."
5,"I ordered a customized vanilla cake with chocolate buttercream for my fiance who lives in Bangalore. Since I don't live in Bangalore, I opted to go through zomato for a decent bakery to get the cake delivered. I was worried how it would turn out to be and whether it would be delivered in midnight or not but keshav and anitha did a fab job. The cake turned out to be exactly like I wanted and was delivered right on time. My fiance loved the cake which had a human topper with a video game console and beer bottles since he is a big video game buff and said it was delicious. Very happy to choose floured. Thanks for the experience keshav and anitha!"
5,"The cake looked beautiful. It was exactly how I wanted it! The cake was very creamy and soft.I loved the flavours- it wasnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât too sweet like many cakes, it was a perfect balance.All in all, one of the best cakes IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâve had."
5,"I ordered for a chocolate cake with chocolate ganache filling and topped chocolate buttercream..thats the most amount of chocolate anyone could think of.f.. to top it up the cakee was decorated with rochers and kitkat. The cake was not over poweringly sweet, which is every chocolate lovers paradise. The balance of the buttercream and ganache was perfect. Each layer had its own flavour, which struck chords to the most delightful taste. Thank you Floured for customising the order, having a professional approach and delivering the cake on time. My favourite would still be the dulce le leche brownies with walnuts. This was truely orgasmic as my friend called it.. its nothing like ibhave ever had before ... every bite, left you wanting for more. A must try for all the chocolate lovers."
5,Awesome Cupcakes.... Were a star fr my day... A true icing on the cake!! They were indeed baked wid love! Baked to perfection! Loved them @Brahm Jyot SinGh
5,Thank you so much floured bake for the wonderful cupcakes ? it was too yummy and couldn't stop licking my fingers ?. You follow exact time management too . All the best ?
5,"Despite knowing Anitha for many years now, I had never tasted her dulce de leche brownies until recently. And boy, am I cross about it! These little brown wonders are easily the tastiest ones I have ever had. They are oh-so-soft, melt in your mouth, and are utterly delicious. So much so, that the dessert vanished from the lunch table much sooner than our mains. If you thought no one can eat just one applies only to your favourite bag of chips, wait until you bite into one of these! A must try for everyone who love their sweet nothings :)"
5,"Working with Anita has always been seamless, especially since i dont live in the country. I had first ordered a red velvet cake for my mom's birthday. My entire family loved the cake. The way it looked and the taste of it.So second time around for my parents 40th wedding anniversary, I decided to go to her again. She was very accommodating (considering my mom is a tad bit picky :) ) and gave the right suggestions to make the perfect cake. The cake looked absolutely gorgeous. I got a vanilla cake with a layer of vanilla icing and chocolate ganache layers in between topped with vanilla icing. My parents loved it. It looked so delicious as well."
5,"We are so glad that we chose Floured to make Customized Cupcakes for our son's bday. They were an instant hit!!! They looked n tasted equally good.Keshav/Anita, really appreciate all your efforts in arranging the toppers(as requested) and delivering on time (as the Venue was far from the city).Looking forward for more yumminess!!!"
5,Life is something to be celebrated every moment but then we would go bankrupt and hence there are celebrations that happen every now and then! And that's where Floured has played an important role in our life by making it more splendid than it is already. I have been ordering cakes from Floured from past 2 years and I am more than happy to say that the level of creativity and the deliciousness always amazed me! My nephew is also a big fan of the cake Aunty and always insists to get something from floured - this time it was mesmerising set of cup cakes !If you are looking for celebrations that remain permanently etched in your memories - you have stopped by the right place :)
5,"I have had cookies, red velvet cupcakes and pastries. All are awesomely yummy and tasty. Try once and you will ask for more and more. GO FOR IT PEOPLE !!!"
5,"the brownies and the red velvet cupcakes , these two are awesomely delicious and i order when they are coming down to Mangalore.. also not to forget the yummy plum cake during christmas.. you got to try it .."
5,Ordered a red velvet cake for my uncle on his 50th birthday & a lemon flavoured cake for my son's birthday & all of us loved it! Their lemon cake is d best lemon cake I've eaten till date!!!!The texture & the color of the cakes were too good. The toppers were excellent. Appreciate the creativity & efforts taken by them to depict even the minute details of the toppers. Would love to order from floured again.
5,"The Dulche de leche brownies, DDLB are to die for! Go get a grab if you haven't yet, you can thank me later!Sitting in Mumbai I get them delivered here with the first person I now travelling and you can never go wrong!Waiting for them to open up a branch in Mumbai!!Good luck, you guys rock!"
5,"The cakes that Floured makes are yummy. One of those rare bakers who use good quality ingredients, ensure rich taste and score full points on presentation too. You can have your cake customised for any occasion. If you get the chance, ask for their brownies and red velvet cupcakes. Once you get a taste of Floured, you ain't going elsewhere."
4,"Very different from the other outlets I'd been to as they serve variety of snacks and juices alongside ice cream. Located in BSK 2nd stage and having many colleges nearby, its a hub for students and the prices are pocket friendly. The rolls and juice were good here but the Burger could've been a little better. They have good value for money. All this makes up for the very limited seating.Looking forward to visit again."
1.5,A big no no.Place not hygiene.Pizza cannot have enough.Sandwich is the reason I gave 0.5 more than 1.0Half of cola was wasted because of vanila icecream in coke!
3.5,"This place is a small joint offering variety of Arun ice creams, pizzas, sandwiches and fruit juices. The pizzas are quite okay and the sandwiches are good to taste. The ambiance is average as it is disturbing with the vehicle noise in the road but other than this, the place is good for a quick snack bite."
3,"A newly opened joint, serves nice ice creams at decent prices with multiple options. This joint is located in Bank Colony Circle, much needed for the locality.We cannot match the ice creams here with other popular shops but good enough for the pricing.Folks here should concentrate on service part, since they are slow although emptied.Never disappointed during my previous visits!Overall,Taste: 3.5/5Service: 2.5/5Quality: 3/5VFM: 3/5bangaloreepicure.com"
3.5,"Small but compact and nicely arranged tables. A good place to cool down in the summer. Might be slightly expensive, but taste's good. Worth a try."
3.5,"Unexpectedly I visited this place. Its next to bank colony bus stop. Ice cream parlur is small but variety of ice creams and milk shakes available here. When I visited I confused what needs to take but staff itself suggested me to try some varieties. First I tasted Gulkand tornado It was awesome taste, who likes more sweet must have to try this ice cream. Later I tasted Litchi and strawberry tornado this also very nice. I tried chocolate milk shake it was also very good. May be weekends crowded, but when  I visited shop not much crowd was there. Service also very fast no need to wait. Totally it was nice experience."
4,"Located at a prime place. Serves tasty ice cream with a budget price. They offer varieties of cone, cup. I liked the chocolate tornado very much. Taste is worth the money paid."
4,"The was a part of the Krishna Bhavan earlier and served parathas and chats as well.They have moved out now into a separate sweet meat stall with sweets and savouries.We took Mysore pak, kalakand and dum rot for take away. They were packed beautifully. Mysore pak was so good. The kalakand was okayish and hence the four star.Otherwise, perfect place for all sweet desires. They have such a huge variety in the sweet section."
4,"Among all the food related options available in Bengaluru, for the sweets, and in particular for Mysore Pak, this was the place recommended to me by a few people. So I just went there to see if for myself; and as I haven't been into Mysore Pak much so I tried Jalebis and Pani Puris there instead and they were tasty as well. I would especially mention the honey clad & stuffed Jalebis, something which I hadn't tasted before. And it tasted pretty damn good! I was definitely impressed."
4,"Have been here a lot of times.. have had dhokla, badam milk and more. The only confusion is in the name meat.. I know it stands for mittai but come on. It's not meat as in non-vegetarian meat. Overall its worth going."
3,It was good place. But they had no table set up. And as usual baskin ribbons chocolate ice cream brought smile on my face. As a chocoholic I prefer chocolate ice cream from favorite
3.5,We've got Three cheers chocolate ice cream and pralines & cream ice cream. Both tasted good but the chocolate ice cream had tasted like a regular chocolate one. And the ambience needs to be improved a bit.
4,"This is one of the 'better' Baskin Robbins stores in Bangalore! Strategically located at a corner, they even have tables (which is a rarity for Baskin Robbins parlours). The seating is comfortable, although it can get a bit crowded on weekends.These are my picks - Banana Strawberry, Cotton Candy, Chocolate Mousse Royale, Mississippi Mud, Bavarian Chocolate, Mint Milk and their new ice cream cake. I wouldn't recommend their sundaes, though. They aren't appealing, and are overpriced.In general the prices are slightly on the higher side. But considering the quality, I suppose the prices are justified!Food - 4/5Ambiance - 4/5Service - 3.5/5Value for money - 3/5Hygiene - 4.5/5Overall - 4/5"
3,Tiny place. No AC.Staff were okayish. The icecreams were great as usual. Delivery was quick and the place seemed a little dull... Could spice it up with some music and interiors. Overall it was fine.
4.5,Small and tiny place having only three tables.. But the taste was awesome and sticky to tongue.. Best place to hangout with friends.. Value for money and wide range of varieties..
5,"Oldest and the beat bakery as my friend told: VERY TRUE. From butter murgu to capsicum puff, it is too good. Heard they have renovated recently, it is no mess, it's cool. But Sunday is holiday. So, plan and go."
5,one of the old bakeries in basvangudi have been visiting them over the years must say they have improved there quality and taste over the years..
3,Visited this place as I was told this is one of the famous and old bakery in Gandhi bazaar. Indeed the bakery items are good but not the very best. prices are not marked on the packed items and you will know only when you take it to counter. Nippat and maddur vada are the must buy items
1,"Visited last week as it was highly recommended. Most of the stuff there smells of onion, including rusks and biscuits. Terrible place. will never visit again."
3,"Was one of the best bakeries few years back. Of late, quality has come down a bit. Prices have soared. Still I visit this place once in a while. I like the capsicum puff they serve."
3,"This was known to be good bakery since my childhood days . But after they moved to new renovated place , they spoilt the taste. KBC was lacking butter and not worth the price. Aloo bun was pathetic as the aloo stuffing was salty . The saviour was the honey cake which was good but not excellent as what we get in other bakeries around Basavanagudi.I would think twice before visiting this bakery again.foodpunditbengaluru.wordpress.com"
5,"Really good for all eggless cakes!I like their cream less cakes, the normal cream cakes are ok.They have good range of biscuits!They also have breads and pizza base."
5,i had been here during our bangalore visit. loved the mysore pak . it specializes in Bengali sweet which are to die for. loved all the  options on the menu.
3.5,Have all the potential to do better but no idea why they are not doing... Well known old name for quality but the outlet lacks the standards...
4,"Sweet Dahi, Rossogolla and RossomalaiThree things i prefer when visit this place, If you find any outlet of K C Das, dont frgt to taste these, They are simply so gooooood.sridhar1206.blogspot.com"
3.5,My favourite place for rasgollas!Have had good experience a lot of times. But there are times when the sugar syrup with the rasgolla was a little stale.Soan papdi is good too here.Seen flies in the food counter a few times.A lot of improvement and maintenance can make this little place popular.
3,"KC Das is synonymous with Bengali sweets. So, for those with a sweet tooth try their rosogollas. Luchi and dum aloo too are tasty. A decent place for a quick bite. A pocket friendly placeFood: 3service: 3ambience: 3"
3,"This place is famous for it's tasty rasgolla's. The rasgolla's are indeed very tasty along with the other sweets and namkeens. They also serve few snacks, among which samosa and kachori are worth trying."
3.5,"Located in the Corner, I usually drop by here when I'm searching for Pokemons in Bugle Rock park.I usually go for a malpua, Which is only 20 bucks ,Even though it's not the real malpua, It tastes good.. Kinda like a crepe dipped in sugar syrup."
5,"Been coming to this place since birth and there is no better place for Bengali sweets than KC Das ( The inventors of Rasagolla)... Period !!! Love their Rasmanjuri and Raskadam, which is my all time favourite."
1,"I have been to almost all the outlets, i must tell they were all really good.But this outlet the maintenance is bad, The chum chum and rasgolla tasted like it is been kept for months..The owner/ cashier dint bother for the complaint.Honestly this outlet is better shut down..It would bring bad name for the brand KC Das."
3,"Snacks and sweets when fresh are really good - this outlet doesn't subscribe to the idea. Rasagullas, kachodis and gebar if u manage to get are good.Mostly you wont get them fresh, so stick to sandes and turkish delight"
2,"Don't come in here with the same expectation as of the one in st marks road. However u don't get the same varieties of food as u get there, they don't the place and the sweets u get here are usually more than a days or two old and are not freshly available . A disappointment and would not come back again :("
4.5,Nothing to beat k c das rosogulla... Same goes for their sohan papdi.... Just melts in the mouth... At another outlet of theirs I had tasted their puri made of pure ghee .. Wow that was something different altogether...
4,"Rasgulla, Rasmalai, sonpapdi and samosas are my favourite here. Haven't tried other sweets and savouries though. Have been visiting KC Das from my childhood days and taste is same. 1 of my fav eat outs. Pocket friendly."
3,"This outlet not the place for the people who are searching for authentic Bengal sweets. They maybe best serving at other places, but not this outlet. The sweets tastes good and ambience is also above par, but it lacks the oomph factor when you have the sweet. Pricing is bit above the expectation."
4,"Stopped by for a quick dessert after dinner at Vidyarthi Bhavan and ordered a couple of treats for myself (don't really remember which ones) and I remember all of them tasting absolutely delicious (yeah, I have a major sweet tooth!). Would definitely recommend the place for a quick stopover to people nearby."
3.5,"After an overload of spicy treats along the roadside stalls in and around bugle rock, we ended up at this place for some sweet indulgence.I love the mishti doi (dahi) here! Even though i miss the small clay pots which they used to come in earlier, the taste has remained the same! :) You do get clay pots of mishti dahi for larger quantity though!"
2.5,"KC Das is a very famous for authentic ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâRasgullasÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ but this is one of the dull outlets in Bangalore. Whenever I go here ended up with empty hands, they will either have old stock or non-availability. This is not only happened once or twice.KachoriÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs are good here but will not available all the time and the person who owns this outlet doesnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât even bother about the customers when someone get inside.I would suggest everyone to try KC Das outlet in Jayanagar (Which is close to this Outlet), thatÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs well maintained and we will get so many options in choosing the sweets. No complaints on the taste and quality.Overall:Quality: 3.5/5 Taste: 3.5/5 Ambiance: 2/5 VFM: 3/5 Service: 2/5bangaloreepicure.com"
3.5,Been here only once and tried the Rasogalla... Was really soft and melted just into my mouthWell if you have a sweet tooth.. no better than place than KC Das..I would like it more if they introduced some chaats/sandwichs here too as too much sweets make you feel saturated
4,very sweeeet.... :-)the rasgullas are the best hereworth a try
5,Extremely fresh cake
1,"The name written on the cake was spoilt, so the cake was miss handled.."
2,"Brought a cake for one of my friends birthday,Picked up the red velvet cake! It was not at all good, it tasted like it was 2-3 old days was very dry."
3,"Pongal is my favourite here and a place for all the South Indian breakfasts,also lunch and dinner . They even sell sweets. Must try is mini Tiffin."
5,A2B is the best sweet and savory store in Bangalore. One must definitely try Milk & Ghee sweets of A2B. They are simply superb. They are my all time favorites of A2B.goo.gl
4,"So apparently I visited this outlet and reviewed the other one as pointed out by the restaurant. Anyway here is what I think of this place.Stragetically located in the heart of Banashankarim 2nd stage close to the KIMS college and BDA complex, this place is a quiet hangout for youngsters and families alike. The decor is amazing so are the variety of teas. There are some unimaginable variants and you would love it. The staff is courteous. And there are some interesting food options too so don't be misled by the name Tea house.My ratingAmbience: 4/5Service: 4/5Value for money: 4/5"
5,"I personally really liked this place ! The ambience with the rooftop , plants , the music is great !The starters are good and so were the pizzas.The prices are pretty affordable! Must visit place !"
5,Very good pizza... took unlimited pizza and could eat 3 pizzas easily per person... even service is very good... staff is very courteous and polite
4,Onward has been a favourite place for a Pizza for quite some time. Their Happy Hour Pizzas and Pizza Combos are to be relished. The pizzas are fluffy and have just the right amount of sauce and toppings to cheer you up.
3,Onesta serves unlimited pizza and desserts with pasta alsoThis places has multiple branches in the city and usually crowded on weekendsService: it?s good and decentPrices : affordableFood: desserts and shakes are very goodBut the pizzas are too thick base ones so until you order something very cheesy or with a generous topping can?t taste itThe choclate banana pizza was a disappointment as was very raw
4,"I like going back to this place. I really like the ambience and the fact that it is a rooftop makes it a cool place to hangout. Although, I keep ordering almost the same thing every time, it has always turned out to be a nice experience. This place is famous for its pizza but, I kinda like their pasta more. Also, the tiramisu shots are to die for and so is the mozzarella cheese balls with a really generous amount of cheese inside. I would surely recommend this place and I would definitely keep going back."
5,"Bakasuras Paradise!The only place that can keep the bakasuras belly happy!My 6th visit, and my 5th different onesta visit!From RR nagar, JP Nagar, Basavanagudi, Koramangala bakasura ended up at an onesta in Banashankari as well!Every visit , it's the unlimited meal that I have had. But, but, but there is a change that's happening. From unlimited pizza, unlimited dessert and a beverage (mocktails and everything) to unlimited pizza, one dessert and one aerated beverage (coke/Pepsi/fanta) , I have been through all! And yet, it never disappoints!The pizzas here are just fab and you can hardly eat like 4-5 pizzas in one sitting (bakasura can.. can you? Yes you can)Coming to the staff, they are great.Coming to the quality, it's great.To finish!Be like onesta!It's Bakasura RecommendedFood- 10/10Ambience- 10/10Staff- 10/10Value for money- 25/10Onesta Love!"
4,It is like any other onesta outlet. But I find this outlet more crowded than any other outlet that I have visited so far. Food wise it's the same no much of difference. But since the place a little huge service is delayed usually.
5,"At times of a cafe bubble in Bangalore, Onesta truly stands out as one the best restaurants with great food, pocket friendly menu and excellent staff. The place often has offers providing unlimited pizzas at prices as low as Rs 150. I have been here multiple times , tasted most of the items on menu and not once have I returned unsatisfied."
5,"This is one of the biggest Onesta outlets I've visited. In the last couple of years, Onesta has made a name for itself. We did not have pizza places that have a buffet option.Like any other Onesta, the taste is right up there and the quick service. I like the thin crust pizzas here. I'd recommend you to take the buffet, ordering a la carte is not pocket friendly."
5,"This roof top outlet of OnestÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ  is one of the amazing places to have the best pizzas in and around Banashankari.Not only the ambience but also the cheerful yet humble service staff catalised my great experience there.Must try: chat pizza, herbed wedges#rajeshwrites"
4,"This is one of the best restaurants in banglore this is a roof top restaurant with a very good ambiance!This is a peaceful place where u can seat chat with your friends with very good starters , drinks , and off course pizzas .They serve these tiny little desserts which look good . Personal favourite was cheese balls and fish fingers .I love the service here it?s quick even during the offers their service is pretty fast."
5,"Food : 4/5Service: 10/5So let's get over the food and the ambience first. Restaurant is big, with high roof, give a sense of space, well lit. Food is great, not mind blowing. We took the unlimited menu, and loved the bacon pizza most. Rest of the pizza was good enough. Among the deserts, the walnut tart was superb, but i didn't like the peanut-butter mousse at all.But, in spite of all that, the reason for the 5-star rating is the service we got. We were served by Mr.Nanda, who made us feel absolutely special. He didn't have to. We were a small party of just two people, we weren't ordering off the main menu, and the restaurant discourages tips. In spite of all that, he was extremely attentive (without being intrusive), engaging and helpful. I have been to quite some places, from roadside ones to five-star hotels, rarely have the service been so heart warmingly good. I hope he goes onto much much greater things in life, because he is absolutely brilliant at his work."
4,"Ambiance - 4/5Service - 4/5Food - 4/5Great pizza, served hot and made to order. They take note of what crusts you want for your pizza and I had the thin crust, so I could eat more, and the crust was made amazing also so was the pizza.The service is really good and the place is clean also. All in all wonderful place and another great restaurant part of the franchise."
4,"Loved the foodie experience here!!!!!! Came here for the name of the week offer and trust me I was disappointed. This whole place has such a good ambience that u l love it instantly.Crazy Bangalore rain and Fresh piping hot pizza and the night is sorted!Unlimited pizzas, a mocktail and did i just hear unlimited desserts?!Goodbye midweek blues!!!?I would specially mention the staff here-Chaitanya,Arup and Binita serving us, they were all so friendly and courteous, never have i had such an experience.What really makes your food enjoyable is just not the taste but how the person served you!Top notch guys!!Coming back for more-offer or no offer ! ?"
4,A beautiful place to dine in.The interiors take you back to the Mughal era. The lightings are just perfect.We went there on the occasion of Christmas and so they had only limited items available. But the taste and service was not compromised at all.The only complaint is that the breads could have been better.Would surely like to come here again.
4,"I was here for dinner with my family on a weekday. The restaurant was completely empty. Ambience is good with some good old hindi music. Seating arrangement are good too. We ordered masala papad, panner and baby corn starters, lemon and corrionder soup, butter roti, olive and chilli paratha. Food was fresh and good, service is good too. Good for family hangout.Cheers"
2,Its a restaurant near to Banashankari BDA. Me along with few of my office friends visited to have buffet but unfortunately they only provide veg buffet. On inquiring they said this place is mostly visited by vegetarians. Anyways we ordered ala carte items which took ages to come. Food was ok ok. Definitely not visiting anymore.
4,We went here on a weekend and one of us had the buffet while two of us took Ala Carte. Firstly the ambience and service of this place is great! The buffet had a lot of items and the good was good. We had a Pumpkin Halwa intm the dessert which was amazing. Must try! The kulchas are great here. Cheers!
5,The best thing about the place is it?s ambiance. Second best thing was yummy ? food. We try buffet and buffet food was not disappointed us.Test ?. ?? ?? ?? ?? ??Quality ?. ??????????.Service: Staff was very professional and friendly.Overall experience was excellent.subirmajumder85.wixsite.com
5,Great food and pleasant ambience. Expensive but Coll place to chill and relax......Service is really very very good and friendly staff...Food : 5/5Service : 5/5Ambience :5/5Overall :5/5
4,"Good ambience with tasty food.Cheese chilli paratha with Bhutta palak methi curry is a good combo.Lemon Chicken in the starters is a must try item.Egg fried rice was also quite tasty.In the mocktails, recommend ""Alice in Junoon"". Do not miss it."
4,You can?t go wrong with Jalsa. Never been a fan of their buffet and thus always order alacarte?. Service at times can be on the slower side but food is worth the wait.
5,Overdelighted by the service and food provided at this place. A royal and ethnic atmosphere builds a strong essence of being in India and also the quality and taste of food is truly authentic. I would totally recommend to visit this place once.
4,The place is nice and comfortable. Food wise all jalea outlets maintain a good standard. The soya chaap was a standout dish. Clearly one of trademark dish as per me and a must try.The only concern is the parking. It very congested and limited to just 5cars. The basement parking is very steep and makes it cumbersome
1,"Food - 1/5Ambience - 4/5Service - 1/5Must Try - NoneClue - Had ordered egg whites omelette, which was super oily and charged 60 ? extra for making it with only whites. Also had a cold coffee which was too sweet. Had a brownie too which was so average. Outdoor seating decor is good, but infested with mosquitoes. The owner who sits near the entrance was frowning as I was trying to greet the super cute Shihtsu doggies lying down at the entrance. I?m really not sure how and who gives this place high ratings."
3,"Food / Drink - Pizzas and pastas. And some deserts. A few soft drinks too. Simple menu. Simple pizzas presented in a very non pretentious fashion. Thin crust is good. Tastes good. Margarita pizza was a tad bland. Sun dried tomatoes were out of stock! Overall, not a bad pizza place for a quick bite.Price - Priced well. Good value quotient. Won?t terribly pinch your pockets.Service - Very friendly staff. Orders taken fast. Food is delivered fairly quickly.Ambience - Indoor and outdoor seating. Covered outdoor space is well laid out. Again, simple interiors and nothing fancy.Location - Opposite to Banashankari BDA complex.Parking - Street. Or in the BDA complex.Speciality - Pizzas and pastas.Must try? - Nah!Pro tip - Pick nice veggies as toppings for your pizzas. Obviously you?d say?"
3,"I had plans to visit this restaurant ever since Zomato promoted with Vinny's video and felt it does not deserve all the hype.We went ahead with Onion Rings, Thin crust pizza slice, Alfredo sauce pasta and Red Velvet cake. While pasta and onion rings tasted good, pizza and cake were a disappointment. They were just average and the cake was dry! Top of it slow service and we had asked for items we ordered on a sparsely occupied weekday afternoon. Pups and dogs were not responsive at all, So if you are planning to visit due to the pets - You better avoid it. 3* for pasta and onion rings. I may not visit again."
4,Went here for lunch and found this place quite peaceful to sit with friends. Pizza which we ordered was great. This place offers you varieties of Continental and you can even go for slice if you don't prefer 12' pizza. Go for this place if you want fire wood ?!! Food and ambience is good.
5,"Been here a lot of times and the consistency of the food and service is pretty remarkable. Never really had a bad experience. It's known for Italian food, especially pizzas, and they taste really good. One of the few places that serve pizza by the slice as well. The prices are very reasonable. The service is good too."
3,"Have been wanted to visit this place from long time. Finally visited this place which is located in Banashankari 2nd stage opposite to BDA complex.As soon as you enter this place, you can just smell the aroma of pizza which will make your stomach crave for eating.The place has many seatings. You will have outdoor seating as well as indoor seatings. On some days you can find cute little shihutzu dogs walking around you which brings joy on your face.Well, coming to the foodOrdered,1) Mozzarella sticks which was very hot and cheesy cheesy and was really yummy which was served with a chilly sauce.2) Alferdo veg pasta was quite sour and quantity was less. Taste was not as expected.3) Paneer Tikka thin crust pizza was hot and creamy with pieces of paneer and dew vegetables on it. Taste was quite good.4) Caramel custard dessert, must try dessert in this place. The dessert was really soft abd mouthwatering.Service- was really good and quick."
4,"Food-4.5Ambience-4.0Service-5.0This is a cute little place right on the main road.Coming to the food I've had the chicken lasagna,alfredo pasta and veg pizza mostly the 3 toppings.One of the best Italian I've had in the city and the service is great and the food is bang for ur buck.Worth a visit if u love Italian cuisine"
4,"My first visit to Vinny's can be summed up as a good one, we were full before entering the place and were basically looking to kill time! Ended up ordering the BBQ chicken pizza and the Margherita pizza (both slices), the thin crust makes it feel lite on the tummy and the chicken was replicating the BBQ feeling to the fullest..We also tried the Caramel custard and loved it too, it was fresh and was nicely done!Next up would be to come here on a weekend and try a full sized pizzas.grubitizer.com"
4,"If you have cravings to have a authentic wood fired pizza this is your place . It?s newly renovated now and more spacious than before with 2 small wallgardens inside . And outdoor seating is well lit and who wants to sit between 4walls as obvious ? food here I recommend chicken bbq pizza , mozzarella sticks , cheese garlic bread , panner tikka pizza paired with virgin mojito ? very neat place , good ambience . One of the best place to have wood fired pizza in south Bangalore ."
4,Place is really neat and very good... U mat see few pet dogs of the owner inside but they are very very friendly... Pizza is good and the pasta was awsomeeeee.... They could have built a restroom though...??... When asked the worker they told they don't have a restroom... But other wise everything is good... U can park ur vehicle opp inside bda complex
3,"Food 3.5/5Service 3.5/5Ambiance 3/5Price 4/5air conditioned NoQuality 3.5/5I'm not found any special in this.. there plus point is , they are prepared their own pizzas and using garden fresh green vegetables.place was not maintained well clean..pizzas were thin in size but big prefer soft :(Milk shakes were taste and quality was not satisfied :(Dessert were not worth .All over one time visit but need lots of improvement in service and quality of food.."
4,"They have the best Pizzas in town. Also, the desserts are amaze too. Iff you love pets and pizzas, this is The place to be. Although m a lil disappointed that you don't get to see dogs in the evening bcoz they r either munching or sleeping or tired of whole day fun. But, anyway you have pizza for rescue.!!"
4,"Food - 4/5Ambiance - 4.5/5Service -4/5Beautiful place with wonderful vibes. Wonderful food along with great ambiance and service. Another highlight here are the dogs that are usually present there most of the time.The service is quite prompt and efficient, the food quantity offered very much matches the quality served. Great place to hangout or chill with friends/fam any day."
4,"We had our get together with our old friends and nice hangout in Banashankari BDA complex.It has wonderful pizza, kids loved the french fries.We had tandoori pizza along with 5 toppings pizza and both were very good in taste.Not to forgot the Pasta and Drinks.Ambience - 3/5Taste - 4/5Service - 4/5Kids friendly - 3/5"
5,"If you are looking for a quiet place in banashankari to sit back relax and have some nice grub, well this is the go to place. Located just beside the BDA complex, this place gives you a nice homely feel. The service is pretty good, but the ambience is also pretty superb. Adding to this there is Muffin and Aldo, the 2 cute cute lil dogs of the owners that walks around spreading smiles on the customer's faces. Coming to the food part, we had the Roasted Chicken pizza which was pretty decent but not something too woo about. Whereas the woo factor came in to play big time when we were served the Alfredo Chicken pasta(spaghetti). The sauce was absolutely blissfull, creamy and cheesy. The spaghetti was cooked to perfection and the chicken inside the pasta was also pretty tasteful. For washing this down we had the Butterscotch Punch and the Mango delight. Overall the experience was one to remember and I definitely would jump on another chance to go here."
5,"This place packs a punch both with its ambiance and food. The place gives you a calm feeling which can relieve your tension.Coming to food, they provide pizzas in slices as well which is a quarter of the 12 inch pizza. I don't like thin crust pizzas but this one was really worth a try. Everything was in right proportion be it cheese or toppings.Next we tried lasagne which was good in taste but to be honest I have had better ones at other places. It had too much tomato flavor. My advice will be to go for some pasta instead of lasagne.Mozarrela cheese sticks is an awesome innovation by Vinny's and is a must try.Last but not the least, we tried Tiramisu and Banofee Pie in desserts. Tiramisu tasted just like an ordinary pastry and you should definitely give it a pass.Banofee Pie was out of the world and is the best that I have had in Bangalore and Delhi combined.A must visit place for non-drinking weekends."
5,Yummy it was !! The pizza's and the deserts both were very tastyyyy !! They are huge in size which fills 4 people's stomach at a time... the liquids are also good
3,Reading the reviews I was expecting really awesome thin crust pizzas but the pizza were good but not awesome or great as I was expecting it to be.The pizza are not thin crust and the taste was average. The staff is good but need to be trained to suggest people options if people are in the first time. In terms of ambience its actually a house converted to a sit in restaurant. If you love dogs there are 4 cute shitzu dogs around the restaurant.
4,"If you are expecting a palatial dining and a gala menu, Vinny's, with a limited menu, may not be your place. But its definitely a perfect spot for tiny getaways, while its thin crust pizzas cater to your taste-buds with perfection. The pasta too is equally impressive."
4,"Lovely pizza, soft and crunchy crust, very cheesy, good quantity of toppings. Ordered three topping veg pizza.Chicken Lasgana was juicy, saucy, and was loaded with cheese.The place was crowded for a Saturday night, but the ambience was still very lively and fun. The service is also great. Would definitely visit again."
4,We get the best and amazing pizza I here try mozzarella cheese sticks and 3 toppings pizza they make the best and worth for the money ambience is not that good.. And the best part is it is an pet friendly cafe they have 4 cute little shih tzu ???
4,"The vinnys in Banahankari is pretty close from my work place so any cravings of eating Italian, and we end up there!The food menu is limited but everything on the menu is perfect as it could be! The pizzas are thin crust and they either server it full or by slice (which I think is a great option). The mix sauce pasta is fabulous, extremely creamy and rich(a must try).Do try the virgin drinks they serve (especially the lemonades in different flavors although I tried the cranberry lemonade on my last visit, wasn?t the best)The ambience is very casual and is easy on the pocket!"
4,Ordered the veg pasta from here on a day of intense cravings. The pasta was excellent. Spicy and filling. And for the first time ever even the broccoli tasted good. Can't wait to go there myself and try their food!
3,"Average non veg pizzas, they just have a single topping that wasn't too great, tried the bbq chicken, however, veg pizzas with the custom toppings turned out to be much better.But for their price I don't feel its value for money, since, I have had much better pizzas. Also, they could do with a smaller size too. Their French fries with chat masala was nice. Overall an average pizza experience."
4,Food - 9/10Service - 8/10Ambience - 9/19Cost - 8/10One of the best place to have pizzas in bangalore. They have wide variety of pizzas and drinks to have. All freshly prepared in front of your eyes. The ambience is very good with soft music.
4,"Good ambiance, and they have the cutest doggos!! ? That's probably the best part! Lol, jk jk. The food was equally good. The pizza was very nice, drinks good too. The nachos could use a little work, rather replace the chips with another brand or something, they were very basic. Apart from that it's been great! :)"
5,Coming here 4th time. Tastes better in each time. Love for their food is increasing each time. Ambiance is not that high class but ya taste is what really matters. Staff is well serving.
4,"Had been with friends here! An amazing place to hangout with friends. Good music, drinks and food. Pizzas are good too. Worth the penny ! Ambience is good but the smoking area is congested. Fries and burger is good but the bun quality is bad. Overall it?s a good place to drink and have fun."
4.5,"Amazing place.. good to hang out with friends... they Have happy hours till 7.. good food , Ambience is also good...Food: 8/10Ambience: 8/10Service: 7/10"
3,"Bad bad experience, firstly the way the customers are treated it was a pathetic experience,Ambience:3 out of 5 since they have this in mind that they are best around which is very very wrongFood:3.5 out of 5 , not bad starters taste was good and spicy"
3,"Ambience is too good, and one of the best pub in banashankri area and it is pocket friendly as well and taste is not that good enough and service is too slow"
1,"Very rude service. My first 10-15 mins experience was waiting at the table unattended. I had to look around and find someone and call them over to my table. They don?t understand simple things like two small drinks make a large. He argued that a large plus large is not possible in gold, two smalls plus two more is all I get. The food was served only warm, not hot enough. The bill came up to a very unhappy sum for all the bad experience"
3,"I've been to this place quite a few times. Love the music here being a lover of classic rock. Its filled with college crowd. Car parking might be a problem but you can find spots right in front of the place for two wheelers.The food used to be really good but the taste has been deteriorating. I used to be a big fan of their paneer chilly but they changed their menu a few months back and they've removed the item itself. Even though they have chilly chicken, they refuse to make paneer chilly. They don't allow any modifications in their food menu. Pizzas are a safe option since they can't really mess that up.Fountain soda in the mocktails is good.Still like the coming to the place since it has a good vibe. Prefer the ground floor since the seating and lighting is better."
4,This place was having such a lovely ambience and it was pretty good place to hangout with friends but now they changed the ambience.. I don't like new one actually anyhow here food is very delicious ? service is very good and they have some refreshment game too and all good.. anyhow good place and good staff ?
4,"I was just going through Zomato to see what places in the vicinity I haven't reviewed. Was surprised to see that I hadn't reviewed Jcubez. This place was our go to place when I was a student. Pocket friendly, close by and had happy hours too. Had quite a few good outings here. Even now if you ask me for a place in Banashankari to chill and grab a drink, I'd suggest this place. But this is more for the college crowd. Loud music and dim lighting. If you want to have a conversation with your friends, it's tough because the music is too loud most times. I'd recommend this place."
4,Easy to locateVFM 3.5/5Taste 5/5Yummy cheesyyy fries ?Delicious pastaThey're a must try ??Loaded nachos and green fries are average!!
4,"A tuck shop in Banashankari, slightly off the crowded Banashankari bda complex. The menu is interesting....and I had no complaints on the food as well. While there is no wow factor in the dishes or the ingredients.... for sure no disappointment when tasted too. Since it is in the concept of fast food, they served in foil box.... unfortunately along with plastic spoon. May be they need to immediately change to a wooden spoon. We tried loaded fries and white sauce pasta...both were good. Will be a good adda for college kids."
5,"Been here multiple times. First visited a year back. Their cheesy loaded nachos were really good. Their waffles, although takes a lot of time to make, do taste quite yummy. Even their white sauce pasta is nice. And the prices are definitely worth the taste. Service is pretty good too. Love visiting this place!"
5,"Being in banashankari, this has to be one of your must visit joints.Remember being in college and having all my gossip sessions here.Resonably priced, friendly on the pocket this is the local hangout spot.Coming to the food they have amazing varieties of fries, nachos and pasta.The owner and the staff is really sweet too and ice creams are amazing?Must try their bubble tea!"
4,Our always go to place when in and around Banashankari. I have been visiting this place since the past 2.5 to 3 yrs. Over the period of time the quantity and quality has a slight dip. The management is as friendly as always but i suggest them to revisit on the quality of the food. Else it is a nice place to go to for a quick snack grab when hungry.
4,"Yummy saucy fries!! Loved every bit of it , and worth the price , al the items on the menu were cheap and the quantity wasn?t bad.. loved their mix of sauces ?And I also tried ordering from this shop online , and they reached on time and was packed very well, I ordered mixed cream pasta it was really good."
4,Value for money everything they offer is amazing. The fries are especially delicious and make for the perfect snack. Been here a lot and tried almost everything they have to offer definitely worth it.
3,"It's a busy eatery in Banashankari, and draws the young in droves. I tried the green fries and the spicy fries and liked the quality & quantity."
4,We ended up here on a Saturday afternoon after an hectic dayThe food was too goodThe ambience is okayBut usually it?s crowded with the college students aroundFood 4.5/5Ambience 4/5
4,"The food was amazing but they might need to work on the pizza and the crepes. The lighting is a little bit on the dimmer side, but the ambience is quite good because of the comic theme."
5,"Best waffles?? I am coming here from past 1 year! Good place to chill with friends! Good ambience, good food,!! Must visit place if you?re in and around Banashankari"

4,"CafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå© which is very near to my home did outreach my expectations. I did like the ambience and service in this cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå©. Ordered Mango and Almond Smoothies with Potato Wedges, Pesto Veg Pasta. It was just lip smacking. Again, the next evening i took my wife to the same place and had Alfredo Veg Pasta, Chilly Baby Corn, French Fries, Black currant and Lychee Smoothees and turn out to be good. I recommend this place for my friends in my neighborhood!"
3,"This cute comic book themed cafe is one of the closest hangout places for college students. It is fun if you go with a group of friends. The food is kinda good but not that great. Pasta Alfredo has too much cheese which kinda starts making you sick of it. I don't know if that should be considered a good point or a bad one xD Also, I wish they gave garlic bread with pasta and not the regular one :( Pizza is okayish, pasta arrabiata is good. This place is famous for Chilli cheese Maggi and blue lagoon. They are super tasty but kinda overpriced. Sandwiches, waffles and nuggets are also pretty good.The place is really pretty, a good hangout place but nahhh, I wouldn't suggest you to go there if your sole purpose is to have good food."
3,"A good place to sit with a bunch of friends and hangout.. food tastes good and the service is also quick.But a boring place if u go with a just 1 or 2 people.Usually not crowded, and this place can be easily located while passing by."
4,"Food - 4/5Ambience - 3.5/5Service - 3/5Easily the best cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå© in the neighborhood and possibly the only one not including the CCD's that you find at the end of every road.Appears to be a popular place for smokers to chill at, as the smoking area looks very quaint and comfortable.I would recommend their pancakes with chocolate syrup and ice cream which I've enjoyed everytime I've been there."
4,"The Coffee Shack is one of the lesser known, but cozy places in BSK 3rd Stage. It's located just a few hundred meters from PESIT on Outer Ring Road.? Standout Features of The Coffee Shack:??Nice ambience??Not too crowded??Good pricingThe food is quite good and service is very good. Since it's not too crowded, this is a good place to catch up with friends for a long conversation.I've been here on multiple occasions and haven't been disappointed any time. Some dishes need to - of course improve, for example the Nachos which are served with cheesy sauce all over - making it completely soggy.Star Factor:Ambience: ????Service: ????1/2Food: ???1/2Quality: ???1/2Presentation: ????"
2,"Though the presentation of the place and food looked good, nothing that i ordered tasted good here. For starters, though the name says Coffee Shack, there is hardly any coffee options. The masala tea was machine brewed, the hot chocolate tasted like watery bournvita milk amd the garlic bread was very salty.The management has to put in extra efforts to deliver good food."
4,"Cozy place with good varieties. Been for a weekend brunch. Thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes. Masala Maggie, scrambled eggs, pasta all were up to the mark. Quite highly priced though."
5,"The food was amazing, the chicken barbecue literally gave me a foodgasm, the nachos were also good, the chicken and spaghetti was yummy.The desserts might need a little bit more attention especially their choco fantasy brownie(it was a bit overpriced) but otherwise it was a memorable experience."
4,"I had read good reviews about this place, so we decided to try it out yesterday.My order-1. JalapeÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå±o cheese balls-Yummmyyyyy. And good quantity for 2 people too.Very good cheese filling on the inside and crispyness on the outside.A must-try starter.2. Veg Alfredo Pasta-The sauce smelled incredible, and the pasta tasted even better. Everything was cooked to perfection, with right amount of cheese and vegetables.My favorite dish of my order.3. Virgin Mojito-Refreshing drink.4. Smokey Chicken Burger-It tasted good, but not great. The patty could?ve had little less meat. I?d rate it 7/10.Overall, the place had ample seating area, and courteous staff.I had a great time here, and I?d recommend it to all. ??"
3,"Cozy and comfy place located in hoskerehalli near banashankari 2nd stage. Easily identifiable as it is located in the busy main road.Food:1)veg paneer pizza which is of thin crust. Tasted very dry and wasn't hot.2)twistato was tasteful. Where two pieces are served in a plate with tomato and mayo sauce.3)virgin mojito was refreshing in the end.Service:Was quiet quick and staff people were friendly.Ambience: Outdoor seating available with plants around you. But it seemed to be like a smoking zone.When you enter inside,it's quiet spacious with many seatings and books around you with all photos on the walls related to food.There is one more section if you go inside,where screening is available."
4,"It's one of the few good Cafe's in Banshakari.If you wanna just chill and play some board game with your friends,this is literally your go to place?The food is amazing too(savoury crepes are must try)Coming to the ambience,it has really good interiors and very very calm place to study too!The staff is very friendly and the service is good"
4,"Nice place for coffee and just chilling out with friends. The price is justified for the quantity and quality of food. We tried Caramel latte, naughty choco jar and nutella banana shake."
4,"Visited this place on a Friday evening...very relaxing ambience for both smokers and non-smokers with various board games. Had ordered corn cheese balls, garlic bread ,green apple juice ,spinach corn savory crepes, french ratatouille with rice. All the food delivered were hot and yummy. You can take one corner in restaurant and enjoy food with uno..ludo ..chess .. snake ladder. Overall a weekend well started ."
4,"A cosy walk in into a enjoyable time with amazing food. It's on the main road and is not difficult to spot.They don't delay in serving except for first 10 minutes then u get food all at a shot (uncool, Caz we asked them to serve our later) but we forgot everything once our buds touched the feast.The really cheesy fries, Aribiatta pasta, and the sandwich, were AAmazingg. The food here is not disappointing, n you find good variety.Not over priced either, since it's a new opening.They have a separate area for smoking, normal dining and an air conditioned room, choice is yours.Peaceful for business talks or studies.Food - 4.5/5Ambience - 4/5Price - 4.5/5Service - 3.5/5Recommended for any meal, peaceful and in budget food."
4,Located near BMS college of engineering.Food quantity is good for the price!You must try the leefu chicken and chilli garlic noodles!The chicken lollipop is also good.Small place but service and home delivery through zomato is good.
4,"We got home delivery from here on a Sunday night. It's good Chinese food and not very heavy on the pocket as well. The chicken soup was good, so was the chicken wings.Liked it. :)"
4,Its a good option for affordable indo Chinese cuisine in the neighborhood of Banashankari. Food seems a little spicy and oily. Will definitely satisfy your cravinga for some Chinese food.
5,The staff in Szechuan Dragon is extremely friendly and well trained. The ambience is great. A must visit place with friends and family. The food is served in a reasonable amount of time and is great.
1,"One more place with wrong over rating stars.... Not worth saying anything the food was so bad and didn't tastes anything, it was like just some stuff which you can eat... Surprisingly the dish was their chef's special..... Lol seriously how do these people get their food licenses...."
5,"Well what can I say about this place, it's one of the best Chinese restaurants I have ever been to. We reached here during the closing hours of lunch. First we had the Manchow soup which blew my mind. It was followed by the shredded chicken which was also mesmerising. They we had the mixed Fu Yong which didn't live up to my expectations. Then we headed on to the main course of Singapore noodles accompanied by roast chilli chicken. Everything was unbelievably good. Definitely going back"
4,"Dont go by the looks and location of the place.. you may be suprised by the no. of parcels going out and people at the place. The food will definitely fulfill your ravenous chinese appetite. The whole menu has a lot of wonderful food.. try the lollipop, hunan prawns or chicken, Dimsum chicken.Staff is polite and service is fast. The handwash facility is something to improve. Enjoy!"
4,This is just a jump from my house.Today bought manchow soup and spring roll it was nice.Noodles was good. It was packed well. Next time will have at the resturant itself for better taste.
3,"To be honest I have had better Chinese than this, it's not a bad restaurant it's just mediocre it's not the best or something getting excited over. We ordered some Pepper lemon coriander soup, i expected it to be little tangy and spicy as the name suggests but it was not that great. Leafu planner and Dragon mushrooms were not bad as well. Dragon chicken seems to be good. We ordered pulpy orange for a drink it was okay. Prices are reasonable and quantity is okay. As I said earlier it's not a bad restaurant but it's not something I would I'd die for."
4,Heard that this place is listed in top 100 must visit places in bangloreSo decided to visit it and it did not disappoint usThe place was small with around 12-15 tablesWe have orderedVeg wonton soup - 4.5/5Leefy baby corn -5/5Dragon chicken - 4.5/5Butter garlic rice - 4/5Pulpy grape juice - 3/5Dragons liar - 4/5Dragons liar is an ice cream and it presented along with fried noodlesKind of weird combination but tasted good
4,"This a simple laid back restaurant with minimal ambience, pretty famous among college students as the prices are reasonable. It?s also one of those place where people visit only with word of mouth, as it doesn?t have eye-popping sign boards or anything!Have been here quite a few times, the food is good and it?s not very greasy like most Chinese places.Got general Tso?s mushrooms, Kung pao babycorn and honey chilli potatoes, all were good.Main course was leefu fried rice, schezwan fried rice and veg ball manchurian sauce, all were sumptuousSo if u r looking for a quick fix dinner and nothing very fancy, this is the place"
3,Food - 8/10Service - 7/10Ambience - 7/10Cost - 8/10Very good place to have variety of Chinese food with variety of sauces. Food tastes good but they can improve a bit. Their service is fast but for home deliverys they are very slow. Ambience is fine with low light and soft music. Usually crowded in dinner time.
3,Dragon chicken has no cashew in it and Thai fried rice I couldn't find any difference from the normal fried rice.Packaging & food quality was good
4,"Excellent food I had a spicy corn soup and sholey ke paneer. The soup was average, but the paneer was excellent. Great service. Excellent ambience."
4,"Good place for a vegetarian food lovers, good service by the staff and the dishes were also quite ok in taste and appearance. Overall nice experience coming here."
5,Our go to place when ever we are looking for comfort food. Food wise it has been awesome since years. The quality of the food has been consistent since many years of my visit. One of the best vegetarian restaurant in this locality.
4,"They are perfect in preparation of vegetarian dishes, when we talk about North Indian food, this is something which you cannot find in other restaurants.I have been to their Jayanagar outlet many times so I planned for dinner here this time. I already a fan of 1947 for vegetarian dishes. So this time I have tried Panner Tikka Dum Biriyani and Panner Lababdar gravy but this time I didn?t liked Biriyani because it?s not actually a dum Biriyani, taste like a regular Biriyani, So I?m cutting a rating for that apart from that everything was fine. It?s been a while and it?s a late review. About the ambiance, which is very desi Indian styled restaurant and all the staffs are very active in serving food dishes.So I will recommend this outlet to all veg food lovers."
4,"One of the best places for north India food lovers, it being a veg only place makes it a great option while going with family.Lot of options to choose from.Service is very quick even though it?s always bustling with people, the menu has improved a lot from when it was started.Have been many times , so not naming any dishes, except for a few dishes all are well made and tastes good."
4,"Service and ambience is good, food is decent( neither too good nor too bad)Their buffet is better than a la carte. Zomato mentions opening time as 7pm, but they start giving seats by 7:30"
4,This place is very close to my house. Went here for lunch with my family.This place is small but clean and appealing. It stands out during the night with all the lights lit up. It looks fabulous.Service is good. Staff is busy and occupied but they do suggest what's good and how much is sufficient.Food is very good. This place is a must for vegetarians if they don't mind shelling some extra bucks. Everything we ordered was delicious. Baby corn tandoori item and the veg kheema gravy were the best in the lot. I still remember the taste.They do have buffet. I always like a la carte as the food is our choice and not from restaurant.A thumbs up from me.P.S - the lift does not work
4,Our experience was a pleasant one. Food was tasting good though the service was very late. We enjoyed the food right from starter to main course. Can visit once for dinner or lunch. Try Indian cuisines is what I recommend.Price:3/5Food:4/5Quality:4/5Quantity:4/5Ambiance:2/5(too clumsy and noisy)Service:2/5(very slow)
3,"It was just the name which made me to visit this restaurant.Thamboola is a kannada word which depicts symobol of something good happening whereas it's a cocount given as something good to happen and often offered to gods.Well coming to this restaurant,I must say ambience is pretty good.Food was very much spicy than expected.Tomato soup didn't had much salt in it which made us to crave for that at the beginning itself.Rest of the food was not bad !!! Would like to visit the other franchise sanchurro which serves italian some time soon.Ambience : 3.5/5Vfm : 3/5Food : 3/5"
3,"A nice family restaurant well located in Banashankari. The food was authentic North Indian perhaps one of the best I had but it's low on hygiene for the price we pay.We had ordered paneer butter masala and Bhindi do pyaza for the main course. A bunch of butter naans,lacha paratha and butter kulcha.The naan is pretty big compared to other restaurants so be careful if you are ordering more.Both the currys were excellent and the naan was soft and smooth.But the tables and glasses are dirty. They have a mat on their table which is filled with dirt and hasn't been cleaned for years. The glasses have stains on them too.Overall the food prices r lesser when compared to other restaurants offering the same quality food.They have a buffet too.Food: 8/10Ambience:7/10Prices:8/10"
4,"It's a pretty good place to be in, the ambience is peaceful, the service is clean and apt. The food tastes great and they have quite a few varieties. It's economical and worth it."
1,"The ambience is good. However, the tables r not cleaned properly and looks very ugly n unhygienic. Service is very poor and need lot of improvement. The description of food doesnt match the food that is served. Glasses look very beautiful but food particles can be seen inside it. It's high time to change the injes of restroom doors."
3,"The ambiance as visible from the road below is the reason why I wanted to try this place. Went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.There was a buffet on offer for 299+taxes which I choose to not take and instead went for a la carte.Here are the details on the order and how they stacked up.Paneer Tikka: Soft an flavourful, 8/10Cashew and Dhaniya Pulao: Very buttery with loads of cashews. 7/10Veg Jhalfrazy: A regular tomato based mixed veg gravy. 6/10Disappointing that on a Saturday afternoon they did not have most of the option for deserts. The only one available was gulab jamun which I choose to skip.Overall a decent experience."
4,Soup and starters are very good. Main course was ok ok.. deserts were also good.. Average ambiance.. restaurant is well situated near to Devegowda Petrol Bunk and KIMS.
4,"Good place, great ambience, good food, family type, good service.happy vijayadashami folks.And happy birthday mywifey.First time visit- ordered soup, babycorn manchurian, panner recepie, some kulchas and 2type curries finally curd rice all were good."
3,"Heard about this restaurant from a friend, so taught of trying it, placed an order on zomato as it was within the delivery range... Food was decent nothing great, value for price.."
5,"A great place for dine-in.The ambience is just perfect with yellow lights and red glasses.The staff are very courteous and prompt.We went there for dinner on a Monday night and still the place gradually filled up in no time.For starters, we tried the spring rolls which was just mouth-watering and too yummy.Next,for main course,we ordered veg kolapuri and butter naan.The naan had generous amount of butter but the show stealer was veg kolapuri. It was simply outstanding and really made our day.Looking forward to many more visits to try out their curries."
4,"Namaste !I recently visited thamboola in banashankari . The place is small , cosy and has a very nice ambiance . The service was also good .The food here is mostly north Indian and Chinese.So for the appetizersWe took tandoori babycorn and tandoori aloo and Gobi . Both the dishes had the same marination and tasted good served with green Chutney and salad.For the main courseWe took american corn noodles and veg biryani . The biryani tasted good which was served with raita but the American noodles was not that great . It dint have the wow factor !! Also the forks were not clean .Overall the place serves some good food . A pocket friendly place !!Food - 3.5 /5Ambiance- 4/5Service - 4/5"
5,"Thamboola a place were dinner was delicious. Qantity and quality food was good. Basket of roti was enough to fill tummy of two people. Staff was co-operative , ambiance was not that decorative but the taste really matters which was good."
1,Very bad experience staff are very rude and not friendlyWe very not even given a chance to see the menu the manager was not interestedAs we were in a hurry we told we I?ll have half portion and the the other half take away or parcel for which he denied and said we Do not a have half and half parcel policy so when asked what are you going to do with the leftover he said we put it to the trashWhich was the disappointment so we decided not to eat and walked out
3,"Ambience?4/5Service?5/5Food?2.5/5Great location-right on the main road, nice ambience, good service. Wine and dine kinda place, great for an evening hang out or a casual chat. Hookah is an added bonus.Food can be better. Pasta and pizza was average. House wine is a must try. ??"
5,"Nice place to hang out, great starters, good interiors, enjoyed it with good music and family and wine. Park view from balcony simply superb"
5,Friendly staff and great food.. good variety of sparkling wine collection... Tandoor varieties tastes good.. along with some good spread of Chinese Italian Continental and mocktails .. lovely ambience post five in the evening for a relaxed time..
3,Ambience is not that good enough and it's not a pocket friendly cafe and the quantity is not that good and desserts are too good enough ??..
3,"RATED Went there for a quick bite with friends.The ambience had more of corporate feel. I would say it was unique.Tried nachos, pasta churros and lasagne.Nachos were pathetic.( Seriously don't order)Pasta was okayish.Lasagne was good.Nutella churros were the best.Overall an okayish experience!Peace ??"
4,"First of all, a big thanks to the staff of this Cafe. Very polite and courteous.I was there 15mins before their closing time. Without any discomfort or hesitation, the staff welcomed me with a warm smile and said they're still open, though they were preparing to close the cafe for the day.Quickly ordered the Thai green curry, which is served with rice. They got it for me within 10mins, hot and freshly made.It was tasty with the taste of coconut milk. Not very spicy, it was mild spicy.I saw they had yummy looking dessert menu, should go there to try them out!A good spacious place to hang out for coffee, pastas, pizza or Thai food."
3,A place for people who love churos. Otherwise it's a normal simple cafe like any other in town . Can go and spend the evening there . The positive being it is one of the better cafes in and around Banashankari and also the place is not very crowded .
3,Have been visiting this place since years. The quality has gone down drastically. Food quality has become very average from good. Service is also very bad of late.
1,Really disappointed with the place.Seems like a old dusty store room stacked up with old sofas and chairs! The decor is soo disappointing that I cannot put it in words!Lastly the food was cherry on the cake to make it a complete worse meal.This place is the last option you should ever consider.
3,Congested atmosphere due to smoke from kitchenAmbience was kService was k .Churos was a new experience recommendedNear to kims . Parking was not der
1,"Cockroaches !! I Repeat cockroaches!!Bakasura was disappointed.Being in Banashankari, being a gold outlet and nesting them? who can even think of that. Thankfully it wasn't over bakasura's plate. The ambience was last cleaned a decade back i guess. A cockroach just walked over our table. As it was alive, and well moving , the bakasura couldnt take a pic of it. Then the staff had to actually take it out of our table. Such ambience ? like what are you upto?Bakasura disapproves. I dont even want to talk about the food."
4,"A nice place to hangout, this place looks professional and also cute. If anyone is trying churros for the first the time, this is the place to go. Cheesecake is pretty amazing too.Recommended."
4,1) pizza mocktails shakes and churros really very good2) staff good3) ambience simple and nice good4) location of San churro cafe very nice5) over San churro cafe good....
3,"One of my favourite places that I often visit in South bangalore , but quality has been reduced than before. Little unhappy with the food this time.But their churros never dissapointed me. Staff are too slow and do not respond easily.Soups:Minestrone soup was like vegetable stock water with vegetables in it, not happy with it.Churros :It was great as usual. A must visit place if u love churros.Starters:1. Africano panner -It was bit sweet and not happy with the dish!!2. Loaded nachos -This happened to be their one of the best dishes, but now I take back my words. Very dissapointed with the dish.Main course:sicilia pizzaPizza was too good, it's a must try dish.Finally I would recommend this place for churros and pizza .Taste : 6/10Ambience :7/10Value for money : 8/10Overall experience : 7.5/10"
4,"Visited this place long before, place come to.notice with the decoration lights outside the cafe. We ordered churos, pizza and hot chocolate, all were good just I little priced more."
4,"Spain pictures of Churros triggered Nostalgia about it , which led to Google search for Churro places in city , lucky we to get the result as San Churro cafe , we had an delectable churros here along with hot chocolate and Nachos ! Thanks for fulfilling our thirst of Spanish Churros !Food : ???Churros ???Hot Chocolate ?Nachos ??Service : ??Ambiance : ?Cleanliness : ??One drawback : Store had some flies, I hope they take care of them for our next tour ?"
3,"?Chocolaty and churroic experience?Hit chocolate and churro with chocolate dip in the picture.My first time at this restaurant and it has delivered in service, options as well as taste."
4,"Though very sadly the place looks in need of retouching, but the food was great! Especially when it was super cold outside and we were super hungry, the staff was nice. We ordered the pink pasta and a pizza. Both of them were pretty good. Was really tempted to try their Churros but we were stuffed. Worth a visit and try for sure!"
3,"Churros, the restaurant's eponymous offering, has to be tried. They're a Mexican snack and served with chocolate sauce. Milkshakes are good too. The interior walls have murals and writings all over. Haven't tried the pizzas here but the cakes and pastries were pretty good."
3,"Honestly, have only tried parcels and that too only starters and mains - never tried desserts. So this review is based on starters and mains only. The quality wasn't all that great, was pretty average."
4,"Visited this place for the first time, recently. The ambience was pretty good. We ordered two 'churros for two'. Having churros for the first time ever, I was way too excited and judgmental. But swear to Lord, the churros were heavenly! The chocolate sauce was the actual chocolate sauce and not nutella xD We had taken the Cross Country Ranch pizza. It was a thin crust pizza loaded with veggies.The place is famous for churros (the name suggests so). I would love to visit again to try all the other items out :')"
4,"I love the desserts more than anything here !Good place and well served !:)We dint like the nachos here , it was not that good as we expected !Except nachos almost all dish were quite good!"
2,"2nd time I have visited this place and I am surprised to see how it has declined. Churros was hard, pizza was pathetic, loaded nachos and masala Garlic bread were topped with cheese with MAYO! Yes mayonnese.. Soup has the bread crumbs in almost melted state, mocktails were average and our only Savior was pasta and caramel pudding... This place has high potential but let down by dull ambience, pretty slow and inattentive staff. Buffet price was listed as 399 but was charged 499, We still went ahead and took the deal to be very disappointed!! Most dishes were freshly cooked hence going with some starts else would rate them lower. I did not find a single person who seemed happy with their meal as moat complained about one thing or the other. That'll be my last visit San Churros."
3,Decent food( nothing extraordinary) chicken manchurian was good.Big portions (ask for half portions)Had a not so good experience today!! Order for the noodle got the rice!!! They said they will cancel the rice and get me the noodle but while billing I was charged for both!!! Had to talk to them to get it billed again!!! Asked a juice with no ice but was served cold !!!Not a great experience all together
4,"good Chinese restaurant. Taste is good.Quantity is great at such a affordable price..good place to hang out.Their chicken lollipop is little bit spicy, otherwise rest of dishes are good. Restaurant staff are also friendly and also have good vibes. Surely visit their branch at Banashankari."
4,"Good Chinese food , delivery gets you more quantity which is actually a very good amount so if u r very hungry n feel like hogging Chinese food order from this place"
4,Whenever I crave to eat Chinese food always first this place comes in my mind. Loved to been here always wd family and friends. Good place to have a perfect Chinese meal
3,"Avg ambience , avg food , good service.Frankly most of the food lacked the flavour punch and tasted bland.Had the raw papaya salad the papaya was very coarse and unevenly cut. The beans that were added were very hard and chewy. The sauce was good but lacked the punch.Same with the gobi butter garlic fry. Felt like gobi manchurian that?s been toned down a notch.The pho is very filling and can be shared by two to three folks.The only good part the portion sizes are really big and hearty."
4,"Truely good food. Authentic,nice and flavoursome was my experience. 2 times I visited both the times food was really yummy as well as their hospitality was great. Prompt service and caring attitude of the staffs what make you feel truely great. I ordered burnt garlic rice, chicken red and green, chicken glass noodles soup and hot garlic fish (dry) apart from the fish dish I liked most of the dishes. Taste and Quantity in both these parameters they scored very nicely.Visit surely ??"
4,"Good place for South East Asian food near my house. Simple menu. Tasty food. Service is not too quick, not too slow. Can visit when you're craving for noodles or fried rice."
2,"Easy to spot, cornered and naturally brightly lit place.The ambience is nice with a wide spread of tables, service is quick and the waiters are polite.Food is a let down. Not really Vietnamese.Lemon coriander soup, Papaya Salad was just edible.Molten chocolate cake had nothing molten about it.Simple place, nothing fancy.Not sure would go back. Place ha a potential and can do better."
3,It is very close to the Deve Gowda petrol bunk & located on the first plot in the lane after Axis Bank.The decor is nice & the staffs are courteous.We ordered for Mekong Fried Rice (mixed) & Hot & Spicy Chicken on the advice of the staff serving us.The Hot & Spicy chicken was unlike anything oriental I had ever eaten & did more than justice to its name. The fried rice was lumpy but didn't taste bad either.
4,"Really loved the glass noodles, this is something I haven?t tried before. Properly cooked but bit of oily, this is the reason I cut one star rating for the review. Vet. Non veg fried rice was well cooked and mixed with Chicken, tiny Prawns and and tasty and it was well worth the price."
3,A restaurant with basically nothing Vietnamese in it. It's just another Chinese restaurant around the block. The place was bustling with people around dinner time. The food we ordered was good but again contrary to as expected nothing Vietnamese. Portions were good and service was prompt. Prices were also fair enough. just about an average place.
4,"Had been for dinner date with Ajay Babu after a while. Good place to have peaceful dinner. Tried their varieties of Cuisines. Enjoyed Rice flour Rolls and Glass Noodles with veggies to the core. Must try for rolls and glass noodles...Price:4/5Quality:4/5Quantity :4/5Service:3/5( Suggestion: the team can be trained in serving, they are scared while serving the dish.)Ambiance:4/5Food:4/5"
3,"Cozy place.. parking can be a bit pain.. food is average except for some. Service is slow .. we tried multiple options.. especially we liked seafood soup, Red curry, jasmine tea, darshan with ice cream. Overall decent place."
3,Wanted to try Vietnamese cuisine for a long time and finally landed up here.Food : we tried chicken hot and sour soup which was good.The green papaya salad with chicken that we tried was fantastic and tasted kinda sweet and a had pieces of pan friend chicken.Mushroom manchurian that we had was not thar great and was too soggy and salty.And finally the main course was viet kitchen fried rice which was not great though.There ambience is descent and they provide good service.
4,"I visited this place with my friend for lunch last week. It's very easy to spot. It has a decent ambience.Food: we orderedveg dumpling: the filling tasted good, but the outer layer got hard very quickly and it became difficult to cut through.Chocolate Molten Lava cake with ice cream: this was the BEST dish on their menu. The cake itself was extremely side and bouncy. It literally bounced! It was the perfect sweet ( not to sweet or bitter). The ice cream that was served with it was good too. The molten chocolate was simply delicious. It's a MUST HAVE.Vietnamese sandwich called BaÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå±h MÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâåÂ : this was my first time eating this, surprising it was very yummy. It had a great and unique flavor, and bread itself was quite unique.Crispy chili basil Gobi: this dish was like a regular Gobi Manchurian, It didn't have any extraordinary taste, infact it could have been better.Service: decent service, kind staff members, a bit slow. Overall good."
1,"The place itself looks decent, with courteous and smiling waiters. But alas, that?s where it ends!I ordered for a Thai chilli basil fried rice and a babycorn in black pepper sauce to take away.The menu says the fried rice is spicy and I ask them to make it spicier, with the babycorn in black pepper sauce to be a spicy gravy too. What I got was a garlicky moosh for fried rice which even my 3 year old daughter was able to eat (bland) and the biggest surprise was that I was given dry vegetables and not the gravy!When I called back to complain, the guy very politely told me that the kitchen was closed and apologised. He also told me that I could actually have my fried rice without the gravy too :) . This is when I had to tell him that the fried rice was in edible and hence, I was calling.Overall, very disappointed."
3,"It really sucks to give 3 star to Vietnamese kitchen but I was so disappointed after having such high expectations.To be clear, service was good but the food was average....borderline mediocre. They do not have shumai even though its listed in the menu and the momo's had a chewy- hard texture. Pho taste was too bland. The broth had no depth of texture or tatse, more like some vegetable and chicken boiled in water with salt and pepper. Lost interest and didn't order the main course.#zomatogold helped. Chicken Pho and Veg momo's came to 490 and zomatogold reduced it down to 310 something.My mind is against visiting again even though my heart so wants to...."
4,Authentic Vietnamese food available here. Perfect blend of flavour and spices in the food specially the Vietnam kitchen noodles and the chicken momos. For the vegetarian lovers the mushroom and baby corn will just go quite well.
2,"Located by the main road, this place is easy to spot because of their huge sign board.The ambience is not very good. The staff is polite but service is a little slow.I ordered crispy black peppercorn chicken, Chu chee curry and Viet kitchen noodles. All were very average in terms of taste and portion sizes were less."
3,Talk about typical bars and restaurants in the heart of old Bangalore and Blue Wings stands out. The furniture is antique so are the songs played. Food offered is good and easy on the pocket. Rooftop is not as great as in-house but that doesn't let you down. Overall nice place to get the vintage feel.
4,Nice place situated main residential area. Average place with no special interiors. Best place to hangout with friends. This place is not for family.Food is very good compare to the other bar & restaurants.
5,The best budget bar even in town. The ambience and the tables are clean unlike other bars. The best you'll ever have in a BAR.Must try golden chicken and raja chicken which just land from heaven to your table.
5,A perfect place for 'Machaaa. Yenne haakana baa' kinda boys. Pakka local bar with amazing food and easiest on the pocket. Will never say no if anyone calls me to this place. Very famous among the surrounding colleges. Especially BMSCE.
3.5,Not a family restaurant for sure. Good food but it's more of a bar with people coming here only to get drunk. Service is good as the order gets to table real quick.
3,"local bar  only for boys .with full of  smoke 1st floor , 2nd floor roof top ok . order food  only sides for drinks dont choose main course . good food in this bar is potato wafers cashew fry capsicum bajjiegg chilli chicken drum sticks( optional)Quality: 3/5Taste: 3/5Ambiance: 2.5/5price : 4/5"
5,"This local bar is where I celebrated a belated new year. It's a normal local bar with dim lights, minimal decoration and old Kannada songs. The groundnut masala and onion rings are a must. I have no clue how the rings stayed crispy for so long. Will definitely have it again the next time. Then there was a surprise, which was not mentioned in the menu. Pork!!!!! Pork Pepper and Pork dry were perfect, the Pork dry more so.The waiter was really very friendly and he actually cared for the customers. Kitchen and billing closes at 10.30pm. But they let you stay till midnight."
4,"This place is famous for the cheap booze and the amazing starters. If you are a non vegetarian, you are in for a treat here. The ambience isn't that great, if you don't get the terrace. A great place to sit down with some friends over some rounds of drinks."
4.5,"They have this onion rings! Man they're so delicious. They supply a mint dip along with it when you know you're a mug down and you're tummy is tickled, don't take a second thought. The food here is so brilliant you can say that by taking your first bite."
4,"If it's the ambience ur looking for then this is not the place for you.It's a legendary Booze adda for the people within the radius of 7kms... food is good, starters are fine no doubt..."
3.5,"Visited the place last Saturday - rooftop.  Its a bar and restaurant, so do not expect cozy or luxurious seating.  Rooftop has simple plastic chairs, with table's for four.  Seating is spread across the terrace, can accommodate approximately fifty people.The middle row is little boring, but the rows on either side is decent - left row gives you the view of the busy Hanumanthnagar 80 feet road.  Service is good.  Ordered for two chicken starters, first one was day's-special.  I wanted something spicy, though it was not, was tasty enough.  Secondly ordered chili chicken, was spicy and quantity was sufficient for two.  Blue Wings should be part of 'pocket friendly bars'.  Cost of two Carlsberg's, and two chicken starters were 590 bucks.  We can visit this place anytime of the month, it wont burn our wallet's.Ambience - 3.5 / 5Service - 4 / 5Food - 3.5 / 5Value for money - 4 / 5"
4,"A very calm n cool place to go for a drink @ night come back!! I visited tis with 4 off my frnds,nice friendly atmosphere!! On the whole 4/5!!:-) worth visiting tis place!"
5,One of the legendary places on the face of mother earth!!!! Waaaat aaa jaalllly!!!!CSL Hinduism block eggshell knocking sheets building shattered Osiris
4,"This is one of the decent Bar and Restaurants in our Locality... Price is affordable and the food is really tasty... I go often with my alcoholic friend.. I use to atleast once in a month before... They do have 2 floors.. 1st floor is filled with smoky and 2nd floor is a Roof Top but no Roof before:-p After a renovation they have a Top.As i said food is really good.. Especially the dishes like Roti, Paneer Butter Masala, Palak Panner, Palak Rice and Veg Biriyani too..Quality: 3.5/5Taste: 4/5Ambiance: 2.5/5VFM: 4/5bangaloreepicure.com"
4,"Blue wings bar and restaurant is a nice one infact the best in the budget. I'm a regular visitor to this place just to taste the yummy chicken. This is the place where you get the best ghee rice I've ever tasted. If you visit the place don't forget to order Golden Chicken, the best in the city."
4,"Depends on whom you go with, what happened just before you landed there. Having said that you'll never get disappointed if you ask for 'Golden Chicken' crispy outer layer with soft tender meat inside, the whole piece immersed in a tasty egg, capsicum n cashew based gravy.Ambience? Well, you are not going there for that anyway.Enjoy responsibly."
3,"New place.. though it's a biryani place,I tried Chinese food. Best thing is the quantity, too good for the price. Food was kind of ok,not great. Definitely worth the price. A slight improvement with the taste will make the place a favourite."
3,Had been here to enjoy ice cream but was not happy. They have tried something new but did not succeed. I suggest them to try something innovative as other Icecream ships do. Haven?t tried their wood fire pizzas still. But friends have suggested that pizza is tasting very good.
5,nic
5,osm yr
5,good burger and sandwich but French fries was soft
1,Gobi Manchurian is not good
3,Not bad
2,phulka was very bad it tasted like I was eating stone
5,This is a small cafe like place. They serve great burgers and pizzas. Their strawberry milkshake with ice cream ( ask for thick) are simply amazing. Also their burgers are extremely affordable and very tasty. I keep visiting this place often for a quick bite.
1,The Brownie was all melted up.
4,potato wedges were bland.
2,gobi wasn't taste at all........some pieces are not boiled well
5,fast-food taste
5,very good
5,Awesome
2,taste was not appropiate
1,The shake was not at all cold. It tasted like bournvita milk. The delivery was 45mins late. It was a terrible mistake ordering food from this restaurant.
4,happy with the service. fries are too salty
4,RATED ok but no so good
1,worst. all items are worst. not at all satisfied. last time ordering here.
5,"Nice & tiny place with sitting next to mane thindi. They have good combination of quick eats with pizza, pasta, chinese, Sandwiches, milkshakes, juices, and ice cream. Pocket friendly. We tried chocolate milk shake, fries, scoop and watermelon huice. All were good. Neat and well presented."
1,not at all good and worthy .
1,The ice cream was not delivered in thermally insulated bag. All the ice cream had melted and was in liquids state
5,super deliver guru
5,good
3,The place ambiance is good. Few foods r excellent and few foods like pasta nd pizza they hv to improve the taste. If ur buying chats it?s actually very nice here nd felt little budget friendly compared to other places
5,Taste should be really appreciated! Hygienic and unique are the words to express my opinion about CornerStone. one must visit and explore. Really cozy place.
5,"small and cozy placetasty foodgood quantity and rightly pricedtake away is an option if you dislike small eaterygobi manchurianfried rice n noodlesfrenh fries , chats (after 4)n fresh juice are must try quick eats andnot disappointing at all"
4,Small place with good taste of fish and quick bites. If your in search of fish curry with red rice prefect place.Chicken biryani is also good and when medium cost.
3.5,"Good Seafood. This palace is just few yards from my home and My wife loves seafood, So had to give it a try. We have had: Crab Sukka, Anjal Tawa fry, Bangada fry, and Fish Kabab (BL), Chicken Kabab and Chicken fried rice till date and we loved the Crab Sukka. Others were good too, but Crab is the best on the menu. Food: 3.5/5Service: 4/5Ambiance: 3/5Value for Money: 3.5/5"
3,"A small eatry Located opposite to Shastri's Bakery on K.R. Road, This place serves some reasonably good manglorean food. It's a small setup with around three to four tables. Fish curry rice and other sea food dishes are worth giving a try. Prices are reasonable. Service is quick."
3,Ambience and service was ordinary. We tried Anjal fry. Taste was decent. They do give home deliveries. Home delivery might be a better option.
4,"Open Dosa is the main charm. Everything is tasty and have got reasonable price with good quality. Ambience is not that good,it is just a normal standard restaurant"
3.5,"Had lunch there , chapathi is good and softTomato rice bath was good .Ambience was okies , place is very hard to find it is in between the small lane"
4,"Jus hit this hotel after a early morning jog or work out for a nice , typical Brahmin style , authentic South Indian Breakfast.Your ears could welcome a soothing light Kannada music of old songs or Carnatic songs along side the fresh fragrance of dosas and coffee .Pocket friendly and the taste is awesome.Tried idli vada, masala dosa , kesari bath and filter coffee , everything under 100 Bucks , wat else , jus visit and feel freshLooking forward to visit again."
4.5,"This small hotel is known for it's homely food. Food taste is different from usual udupi hotel taste. Akki rotti, methi roti, uddin vada and avalakki bath is awesome. Earlier this food joint was located in N R Colony. Now also they have maintained same good quality.  If you really want to taste south Indian food other than usual udupi style food, this is a recommended place."
4.5,"Food tastes like home made food,where everything is self-service and list of menu items are just countableAverage -AmbianceCost-Pocket friendlyThis a option place to save you pocket weight!!!!!!!!!"
4,"A good south Indian fast food restaurant. The taste is good and the service is good. You must try the akki rotti, it is really great. Every food here is above average."
3.5,"Tiny little place someone recommended to me. I do not usually venture out into Hanumanth Nagara, bar some 3 to 4 places. I told akki rotti here was very good here, but I ended up liking Khali Dose here. This Place is total Paisa Wasool though.."
3.5,"Damn tasty kesari bath!! Almost everything is tasty when it comes breakfast food, lunch related food is very average though when you compare it to pretty high standards it sets itself with breakfast food, go early morning and eat!"
4,Homely place. Taste wise its too good. Limited variety of food is available. Chutney you get with methi rotti and akki rotti is amazing. Very light on pocket. Must try when you are visiting south Bangalore
4,Good place for South Indian food for students and bachelors .food tastes Delicious here. If the place was a little bigger it could house families for breakfast too
3.5,"Thanks for adding this restaurant.. This is recently opened restaurant.. I find idly sambar, akki rotti and dosa was good... Price is very reasonable and affordable... I don't no from 4 to 5 days this restaurant is not opening... Located near petrol bank at hanumantha nagar... I can say this is much better than the so called darshanis in Bangalore..Taste: 4/5Quality: 3.5/5Ambiance: 3/5Value for Money: 4/5bangaloreepicure.com"
4,We finally found a good place for lunch in Hanumanthanagar. Dont visit this place if u desire fancies and luxuries. This is a place where we can expect food which is very homely and natural. Very cost effective. Food was good. Two of us filled our stomach for Rs. 66/- . Veg only.
3,Decent food and easy on the wallet
4.5,"1 . Cheap as compared to other hotel.2.Quality of the food is good (no baking soda used).3.Must have Sunday special Masala Dosa and Bisibelebath.4. Popular for Akki Rotti and Menthya Rotti in the evening.Also kesari bath (No dalda, ghee used)5.Regular visitor since 6/7yrs."
5,Delicious food for cheap price..!! This canteen was in Tyagaraj Nagar before..
3.5,A cheap place to eat out when you are low on cash. Don't forget to try out the yummy bisibele bath.
3.5,First expression - Damn cheap!Taste is pretty much good!Not much variety thoughGood for breakfast !
4,"Thanks to Zomato for helping us discover new places which are so located in our area..Situated beside Vishwabharati nursing home,near Hanumanthnagar petrol bunk,this place is a very neat,tidy place..U can sit here and eat at ease..Its a pure veg south indian outlet...U have idlis,dosas,Pooris,akki rottis,jamun,badursha,rice baths and so on..And the best part is you can get half and full plates conveniently according to ur appetite :)I took one akki rotti priced at 15/- and one jamun at 10/- which i don't think you would find anywhere at sucha reasonable price..25 in all :)Do visit this place when you wanna grab something quick , nice south indian items nearby...:)"
5,"This is the super place where u want to have homely food, everthing is nice .. they never compromised on quality for food iteems, Jamoon will be mouth watering!!!! I am regular visiting from past 4 years.... Sunday's will be too crowded..."
4,"Need your own time with kids?? Yes be there then!A lovely play area for kids with a limited Varity of food available for both kids and elders. Thou the place is mixture of play and eatery it is very well maintained and sorted.French fries and sandwich is so well made. Hot and tasty, fresh and crispy..My any day self timing place along with my daughter's presence :)"
4,"So primarily this place is for kids and the cafe is for parents who are waiting for thier kids playing in the arena. The cafe is next to the play area and if there are too many kids then cafe sometimes also becomes the play area, having said that, the setup is nice for the cafe, furniture is good and has a nerdy ambience to it.Menu has ample choices to choose from, since we were running around our daughter, we ordered only Mac and cheese. It took ages for them to get the food, it was crowded and hence too many people and hence too many ordered they can cope with. Anyways once food arrived it was good, not great but good, using penne instead of Macaroni doesn't really qualify it to be called Mac and cheese, taste was good and quantity was ample.Overall it's not cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå© for standalone business but to support the main business."
5,I have visited food box cafe last night. They have pocket friendly menu. The quality of food was really nice. Service was also up to the mark. We will visit again.Best of luck.
5,Good place to hang out with friends and also family. Decent Buffet with affordable price. Not sure about alcoholic beverages. You can even celebrate Spl occasions in there. The team will also get you complimentary cake on special occasions. Liked it!
3.5,Heard about this place online and was really tempted to try their dry fruits Bhel puri and Chinese masala puri and now m in love with this place... Chinese masala puri was my fav chat since forever but had missed it for too long period once my fav chat shop was closed.. But now tat I have a chat shop nearby I can binge eat this delicious chat..
1,One of the worst places ever to go to .I dint have 0 option in the rating scale .i dintvlike the place personally . U can go and experience it once. The food is not at all tasty . And is not hygiene.
3.5,Stuff is pretty expensive over here. I like the masala puri and ragda paettice served here. Juice is pretty good too. A nice place to hang out for evening snacks
5,This is an Awesome Place with Awesome Food. Perfect for hangout with friends and family. Very pocket friendly. Quick and impeccable service. I personally suggest to experience this place
5,The quality of food is very good and hygiene is maintained as well .Good service too.Loved the food. I would suggest people to visit or order from manifest cafe.
3,"This place is very near to Banashankari BDA complex!I ordered veg fried momos , he took almost 20mins to serve the momos and asked 3 to 4 times!I lost interest to eat also anyway finally he served and it was ok ok?Service is very lateAmbience is excellent"
4,"Good food, for a quick hunger fix. Or for a Chinese craving.This is the chicken Hakka noodles with chilli chicken gravy, and sweet and sour coleslaw. The amount of chicken in the gravy could have been a bit more though. The coleslaw went very well with the overall taste.Pretty economical, 160 bucks."
1,not at all a place for sea food ..... the masala fry they offer has no taste no whatsoever .... n the rawa fry is just crispy with no taste again .... its a dark congested smelling dirty place .... not worth the time or the money whatsoever .... mockery of mangalore style
1,Had been here reading the above comment. Which was misleading. The good here is pathetic. Next to this hotel there is a local wine shop drunk people all over. And the waitress are so rash like why the hell have come to this hotel. And coming to the main point. This place lacks cleanliness the taste is below average. A hawker has better food than this hotel. This is my view.
4,Its one off the good karavali hotel.. Here you can have never dosa n bangada masala u love to that in this hotel.... Sometime when I visit I won't be having place to sit n we wait n have our desired food
3,Food was fine but was not properly packed and they took a time more than normal for accepting the order. The rest was fine only the packaging and accepting order needs to be improved.
1,its a worst food and packaging
3,"Today I order dal fry, but it was like sambar, seriously too worst, and lassi was like water, but roti and Paratha was too good, it's worth following, but sometimes they did mistake like this, so please am suggesting to owner look into this, this will bad opinion to the customers on the Restaurant, I ordered here Lote of time, everytime it's too good, but I got like this first time tooooo worst. ."
2,Food taste is not good and food items are not properly cooked.
1,Food was disgusting. It was totally out of taste. No salt. Nothing. No spoon. No gravy along with. Nothing
1,"They have mentioned roti and what I got was chapathi, very disappointed"
2,"LInspite of the instructions, food was not up to the mark. Ghee rice was just a plane rice. plane curd rice."
2,I ordered Jeera rice. I am not sure whether I got the same. because Jeera was there. but it was like they mixed it in Puliyogare powder.

1,Actually we ordered Dal fry they sent paneer grave
5,Paneer Kadai was very tasty.
1,Ordered food online from this restaurant. Food is average and also they delivered my order with a wrong item. Ordered for a 'mushroom masala' but i received 'Dhal fry' which i dont eat.
1,One of the worst food and had to throw to the dustbin horrible abd rotten food
4,"Had ordered devil?s own cold coffee with lots of chocolate sauce in it. My son and me competed with each other for more sips of coffee. Tasted the cocoa fantasy pastry, it was too sweet for my taste buds. I prefer dark chocolate cakes than the normal ones. The ambience is as usual and the cost is on higher side. All in all you can treat yourself to ccd coffee now and then but not on a daily basis."
5,Great place. Can go for a change.... Outdoor seatings..make your own pizza...worth the price. BBQ is heaven here....I loved it... Must try Amruth Govindas
1,"Very poor delivery service, pizza base was on one side and the topping was on another side. Delivery reached 30 mins late and to be frank waste of money..."
1,worst pizza I ever had in my life
3,"Tried Masala Madness Pizza here and it was so delicious. The Pizzas are fresh and they are serve hot. We also tried all their BBQ's and it was not at all good. It was bland and not cooked well.Wish the ambience was much better and they used better interiors and furnitures. This place begs for an attractive ambience.Overall, good pizza but poor ambience.Pricing is overrated. Good service but very very slow.epicuresdelight.blogspot.com"
1,Base was veryyy thin. None of my frnds like it ?
1,"Hygiene is a concern. Though not intentional got the scare of my life when I saw owner lady and her assistant fix the Dustbin and compress it's content, next was to go and start touching the dough for pizza without sanitizing or washing hands. Bad part is they are not equipped. Using manual balloon air filler for barbeque fire starter. one wind is enough to make your food dusty both while eating and during preparing."
1,They don't know how to make pizza. Pizza sauce was watery. So pizza was soggy. It was half cooked. Expensive for the price we paid. Worst food.
1,pizza sucked ass
1,"All I got was a half cooked base and the toppings and cheese was no where to be found, never ordering from here and not recommending to others as well. I just wasted 200 for a half cooked base"
4,"Very good open place...loved the chocolate shake and magic mushroom...??very friendly staff...every one must try the non veg and veg starters if u visit....taste rocks????? serves you with smile which makes u happy,?"
5,Wow..Superb pizzas and barbecues.. By far one of the bests in Banashankari..Pizzas felt so fresh..It will be much better if desserts are also included in the menu.. Good stuff guys??
5,Place that stole my heart away! Pizza here is heaven!! must must try! Visiting here again really soon!??????????Ambiance is decent enough with a very cute sitting. Overall amazing everything.
1,Food not good
1,The pizza was not good... And it got stuck with the box...
5,very nice n good taste best place to hang out with friends
4,If u r a pizza n barbeque lover then this place is for u.They cook their food with a lot of love n enthusiasm so it shows.The toppings were sufficient n so t pizza seemed to hve life unlike t other pizza chains.really hot n fresh pizzas which I nvr get to eat in t usual run of t mill places...Best part is they r clean as they use biodegradable plates which isnt t case with other food trucks...thumbs up from me to tis place
3,"Good place I liked the place, friendly, taste average,Only pizza and BBQ?s are available I suggest for soft drinks also and milkshakesHot and spicy pizza is good i love the toppingOverall good place to have pizza"
5,"Pizza! The one delicious food that everyone on Earth are simply mesmerised by. What could be greater than a super hot, loaded with extra cheese and toppings pizza from As on Fire? At As on Fire, you are never going to miss one of the best thin crust pizzas. Baked evenly in a woodfire oven, it is so appetizing by its looks. One bite and you're drawn into heaven. Its making is done in a truck and this makes it the most unique pizza and a 'must try'. The taste is well enhanced by the fresh cheese used and what makes the pizza more toothsome are the fresh toppings in the best combinations. You're guaranteed to taste assorted pizzas here. This place is more of a foodies hub than anything else and it doesn't stop itself from attracting those non-foodies."
4,Awesome place with good ambiance and great taste but going there at night s better than day times. The pizza?s taste is really nice with thin crust. The prices are also pretty reasonable.
3.5,It's basically a woodfired pizza and BBQ shop. I am impressed with how on minimal budget they have decorated the place. I tasted the masala madness pizza.it was spicy and good in taste. They currently have only non veg BBQs so couldn't taste that. The only negative is that their service is slow. You have to wait a lot to get your pizza.
3.5,"For a new restaurant, this place has a long way regarding ambience, but makes it up for the taste and quality of food. For the fresh one in the block, it's turning out to be quite the competitor, Chicken Drumsticks were just lip smacking. Definitely recommendable to friends and family.Authentic Barbeque food."
3.5,Nice cute outlet fab concept nice food but a big over priced for the quantity servedCan get better if revise pricesEven menu is very limitedSuggest to increase a little more Italian stuff Subhadeep DasAltogether a 7/10 ...
3.5,"A newly opened place but simple and done in a very different concept.With no plans we ended up here at their closing time, yet the crew welcomed with a happy smile. we ordered for the chicken wings and BBQ pizza so that we are safe and know what would be served, but to our happiness both were so tasty.PIzza was so well done with the amazing amount of toppings, I have had enough chicken pizza around but no one adds so much chicken pieces as these people do. they had enough toppings added to keep me happy.A little grooming is definitely required but lovely place to be around with frnds.All the best team!!"
4.5,Wood fire pizza in a food truck is something interesting! They serve very delicious thin crust pizza. I give 5/5 for the taste. Ambiance can be improved and I have given 4.5 just because they don't serve drinking water for the customers. A must try place.
4.5,Good location.Pizzas taste great.Full points for taste.Can improve the ambience a little.Good experience.The only drawback is it becomes difficult if its raining.
1,I was very happy with the service and the quality and the taste of the food till I asked for a glass of water and everyone were blinking at me. The lady who was handling the cash counter mentioned that they sell only bottled water and they don't have normal drinking water. This to me sounds either atrocious or completely forgotten in hindsight. What kind of establishment can you run if you can't even give normal drinking water to your customers? Fix this up first.
5,RATED Quality food served. Ambience is pretty amazing nd the owners r like the coolest people u'll meet which makes ur experience a whole lot exciting...must visit restaurent.!!
3.5,"This place serves pretty good wood fire pizza.... Tangy and fiery... With the perfect amount of zing for your taste buds. The pizza n BBQ might put your pocket a little on fire, but it's worth that tiny fire strike.The ambience is pretty decent...good music..and very interesting seating."
5,"Had ordered pizza exotica and pizza italiano for lunch today, along with two volcano cakes. Both were amazingly fluffy and yummy especially Italiano since it has zucchini which was amaze. Delivery was a bit late but the taste made up for it. Also nice touch of them to give ketchup packets as well :)"
2,"Went to this place for lunch and this was my first official visit to a pizza hut and I have to say that I was not impressed. The pizza seemed dead to me leaving any kind of flavour or punch, seeing the onions in the pizza made my eyes watery as they seemed so helpless when being burnt. Not at all impressed and definitely never ever going back"
5,One of the cleanest south Indian food Joint in Bangalore. Here khaara bath uddin vada is lip smacking.. crispy Masala Dosa.. Taste of the chutney is too good.. Very nice ambiance as well. Never miss this place
5,"I don't anyone who's ever visited this place has anything negative to say about them.Whether it's the food here, or the service, the hygiene or just the basic feel of the place,it's perfect in every way.For ppl who don't know, this place serves a limited menu consisting Idly/Vada/ChowChowBhath/Plain&Masale Dose/ Tea and Coffee.Everything on the Menu tastes perfect. Prices are so Pocket Friendly,two of us have a full stomach meal for less than 100/-It's our go to place when we are looking for a simple comfort food kinda meal.I recommend this place to every one I meet.Keep up the good work u guys."
5,"One of the best places for dose in Bangalore! Perfect quality, unbelievable taste and extraordinarily affordable pricing ? nothing to beat this combination. Whether it is just the dose, or the special pineapple Kesari Bath, or the ever standard Idly-Vada, you can expect to have your mind blown, every single time. Highly recommend this place."
5,"Absolutely the best place to have a low budget awesome tasting breakfast in the whole of Bangalore. The masala dosa was absolutely spot on with the masala and batter and also the crispiness. Priced at ?25, it's just a bliss. Kesari bath and the coffee also were awesome. Absolute VFM. You would have to wait some time to get the food as the place is always packed."
4,A perfect place and a pocket friendly restaurant service it's too good enough and we get delecious masala dosa in here too good ???and ambience is also good enough
4,Good place for a quick bite but you might have to end up waiting for your dosa turn. But very neatly maintained place. Taste wise I would say average. All the score is for their cleanliness.
5,"Visited this outlet recently for a quick bite in the evening.. #masala_dosa and #vada were extremely good.. They are priced reasonably, and sized accordingly.. So order 2 #masala_dosa instead of 1.."
5,"The food here tastes great. Tried Masala Dosa and their kesari bhath. Both were good. The prices here are less, and definitely worth the taste and quantity. It's a very hygienic place. Naturally, this place is quite crowded but nonetheless the service here is very fast and impressive. They have separate counters for Masala Dosa, Idli & Vada, and Kesaribhaat & Kharabhaat. It being a crowded place, you might have to stand eat. A very well maintained place."
3,"This evening I chanced upon this hotel and the rating for this outlet is a point more than the one in Jayanagar. This place is quite spacious compared to the jayanagar one. Coming to the food, I had idly and Kharabath. Compared to Jayanagar branch, idly here wasn't really up to the mark. It was not soft. It was a bit hard and didn't quite like the taste of it. Kharabath here is 100 times better than the one in Jayanagar. While the quantity remains the same, it's more solid here. Atleast u will have the feeling that you actually ate kharabath and didn't drink it like in Jayanagar branch.. I liked it. Finally settled for coffee and it was given to my liking.. No complaints there. Cleanliness is top notch here and there's no compromise on the same. Overall a decent place.. Nothing incredible and nothing worst.. Another joint that serves simple and limited breakfast."
4,"A lovely place for people passing by to crash and relish for a while. It has a fixed basic menu of Masala dosa , khaara and kesari bath , idli ,vada , tea and coffee. The coffee and masala dosa are the best according to me ."
4,"Looking for South Indian breakfast in and around Banashankari ? This is the right place. Reasonable price, great taste,super clean and spacious.This place is not as crowded as Jayanagar taza thindi but equally good in terms of taste and hygiene. I have no count how many times I have visited this place. Only drawback about the place is that you have to pay only by means of cash, sometimes the cashier doesn?t accept big currency and ask you for the change. Also there are no ATMs nearby to withdraw cash."
5,Omg their masala dosa is yum yum. Can never say no to their masala dosa. They cook it perfectly with enough ghee. And the chutney is soo good. Also it is has good ambience and hygienic food.
5,"Food : 5/5 || Ambience : 5/5 || Value for money : 5/5 || Service : 5/5Taaza Thindi makes the one of the best Masala Dose in Bangalore. It's known for its Hygiene and Cleanliness. It does everything right, quality service to mouth watering food. Nobody does a better job of providing the best food for affordable prices. Taaza Thindi has set an example for each and every South Indian restaurant.Must try : EVERYTHINGRecommendations : MUST"
5,A must try place in Bangalore for south indian breakfast. Specially there coconut chutney is awesome. I can say that it is one of my best experience in Bangalore ??.
5,"This is one of the best place in banglore to have dosa , idly , kharabath , vada . It is so cleanly and hygienic place to have breakfast and dinner"
5,"This place is very close by to my home. Amazing mouth melting idly and crispy vada served with authentic coconut Chutney, hot n Crispy masala dosa, kesari bhat is my love and here it was just the way I like to have it and with a cup of filter coffee just full plate breakfast would love to come here again, Simple and amazing taste, worth the money, good quality and hygienic food."
5,"Simple menu, amazing taste and quality.. very affordable price serviced with cleanliness & hygienic. This is our favourite spot for quick snack or breakfast.."
4,Food - 10/10Service - 8/10Ambience - 9/10Cost - 10/10A very good place to start your day with a breakfast but you can always have a bite here. Everything is freshly prepared and served nicely. They always maintain their cleanliness and hygien. Food always tastes good here. A must try place in bangalore.
5,"The reason behind giving 5 star for this place is1.Hygiene2.Quality3.Price4.Ambiance5.TasteAll The above defined qualities deserve 5 stars .The price is first of all very reasonable for the quality and taste what they give . Masale dose is the main highlight in this restaurant along with its authentic taste of the Idlis and Vadas . Khara bath and kesribath is quite unique than what you get in other places in Bangalore..50 rupees is enough to have a breakfast in this place . Two try two dishes atleast..the blend of coffee is really good and refined.Please watch our videos on our YouTube channel Tummy On Fire , like , share and subscribe .Please follow our page Tummy On Fire on Facebook , Instagram and Twitter .Thank you ."
1,I have never seen such a bad restaurant. I ordered food from zomato and food is spoiled. Don?t ever dare to order from this hotel. They just cheat by naming as Hyderabad express
5,"I love Hyderabadi biryani, So I?m eagerly waiting for this restaurant to open to have a great meal. I and my buddy?s are really waiting for this restaurant to open as we can meet up and have a good and healthy meal.??"
5,Food is really awesome the packing of food looks niceGood. I tell my friends and cousins also to visit this site.there are many flavors in ? chicken I tried two of them...
5,"Waiting to have food in Hyderabad Express, because it's hydrabadi, and hydarbadi food is so tasty, every one should taste food from this resturant"
5,"Good and satisfying taste of biryani,nice to see people are coming with such deliciousness in food, thank you so much Zomato,ur fulfilling your word's with restaurant likeHyderabad express in taste and authentication n hygiene"
5,"I'm waiting to taste this delicious taste of Hyderabadi biryani, good food and good services I expect ,youth taste and people of Hyderabad Love this platform Big thumbs up for ur restaurant"
5,Eagerly waiting for the amazing food and delicious meals..Awesome taste and preferenceWow Hyderabad express can't wait more ...Fresh and hygienic food management.
5,"waiting very curiously ? awesome delicious food, amazing time management , and soooo freaking delicious! best hydrabadi biryani and taste thanku"
5,"Momooooooooooo.......? One of the best tasted ever. This place is very famous that people from far distance come here. There's also, spread of pastas. But I choose momo over anything here. They've the seperate counter for takeaways, more like a street style and seating available too. To highlight, very less usage if plastic in the packages. Overall Laaaavd it!"
4,"We ordered Chilli noodles and Egg Fried rice from Roving feast Banashankri. Noodles were really yummy and spicy, they were well cooked and fresh. The Egg Fried rice was a little bland. Overall hygience wise good place"
3,Home delivery order - just to have some starters. Found that they have a wide range of starters- got the crispy chilli chicken and veg momos in manchurian sauce. Momos were a let down- had just cabbage and onion hence not much of a taste. Quantity is good but the taste isn?t. Chilli chicken was good.
3,"Had been here for a quick bite. We tried steamed Momos and paneer Momos in schezwan sauce. While the plain Momos were nice and definitely above average, the Momos in schezwan sauce tasted different. Having a sticky consistency, it tasted sweet but also spicy at the same time.Overall I would rate this place 3.5, but the service here was very slow. Hence the 0.5 reduction"
4,"While it's a good place for pastas, the service here can be very slow. We went as a group of 8, and they had wrongly done a couple of dishes. Taste was fine, but quantity is kind of less, which is understandable because prices are low. It's a small place, so be prepared to wait for sometime."
4,"I am a regular goer of this place from many years and love this place for their Chinese and Italian cuisines which will be served for the lesser price . Love those white sauce pastas and arrabiata pastas which gives some desi feel as well as with those Italian flavours..noodles , fried rice and some main course for the accompaniment is my favorite over here..must try place in Bangalore .you will have lot of choices for the meal..you even get soup and can call it a 3 course or 5 course meal.The ratings :Taste : 4.5/5Quality : 4/5Ambiance : 3.5/5Service : 4/5Price : 4.5/5Please do watch our videos on our YouTube channel Tummy On Fire and do not forget to like , share and subscribe .

5,The best place for pastaaa.. nachos wer also good :) schezuan fried rice was the best !! Mock tails were tasty.. we had taken mojito!! But a place for pasta it is !!
3,"This place is just next to BDA complex??had heard a lot about this place, I was very excited to have their momos??Went here to grab a quick lunch??The paneer momos in schezwan sauce were steaming hot and tasted decent??My friend loved their chicken roll"
4,Food - 7/10Service - 7/10Ambience - 8/10Cost - 8/10Very good place to have pastas and momos. They have a small dine in place but the food tastes really good and fresh always. The staff is nice and active.
4,"Roving feast really a feast to tummy!!!Serves all varieties of Chinese and Italian dishes which is also pocket friendly.Must try---chicken momos ,chicken hakka noodles, crispy chilly chicken."
3,"Had heard quite a lot about this place located opposite to the Banashankari BDA. This place is mainly famous for snacks and quick bites. Pasta sauce is highly diluted and lacks cheese and taste. Noodles are pretty good. I feel that the price doesn't do justice to the quantity they serve. Fries are really good too. The place is great for quick snack if you don't want to spend a lot. But otherwise, you can try meals at the other places in BDA for great taste and value for money."
4.5,"What: fast foodAmbience: compact but neat and clean.This place is very compact but serves some good food tat can tickle ur taste buds.. I visit this place to just have momo Manchurian. My frnd told me abt this momo Manchurian tat was served by this place. N I had never tried it. Just to try this visited this place. Must say, it was best momo manchurian. I just loved it. Also tried Russian salad and pasta which was also very good. One must visit this place in the evenings during winter season and it's gonna be awesome experience.I will definitely visit this place again."
4,"Sunday Noon and my friend and I were damn hungry and we had spoken earlier we wanted to go here.First impressionsIt?s next to a Dominos outlet, and there were very few people but there were many people working in the kitchen but the ambience was quite peaceful.ServiceIt is a self serviced outlet and the staff were busy for most of the time we were there. So was the manager/owner who was there next to the staff, doing what the staff did too.FoodWe ordered Mandakki Oggarne, Paddu, Talipattu and Mirchi Bajji. Apart from the Mandakki, all the other items were amazing and ofcourse its not a fast food joint, so they took their time to make it in the best way they could.PS - Talipattu is a must tryOver all I?d say its a 4/5 only for their sheer lack of understanding of customer service. Hope they are most receptive to the walk-in customers."
4,"Nice place near to kamakya theatre, decent food , girmit was good and worth trying , sabudana vada is nice with less oil ,Ambience:3/5Food:3.5/5"
3,"Ambiance - I really like the rock solid wood furniture used to do up this place and the open kitchen where you can literally see the ladies cooking multiple orders simultaneously.Service - Some dishes are pre-prepared and they take their own sweet time to prepare the other dishes.Price - The prices are on the higher side when compared to the quantity, taste and prices of the other restaurants offering North Karnataka cuisine.Taste - We tried the following items.Mandaakki oggarane - Was bland. Didn't like it.Mirchi bajji - Was served hot yet wasn't great.Millet taalipattu - Best among the dishes tried here. Really healthy and has a unique taste that I haven't got to taste elsewhere.Girmit - Was too spicy to finish.Shenga holige - GoodJowar roti with curry - Tasty but isn't worth the price.* If at all I revisit this place, I would like to try millet bisibelebath."
2,"Unfortunately, this hotel wont survive long.1. Self Service and highly priced2. Absolute mess in the weekend3. Mismanagement of orders4. There is no token system5. Lastly, taste is not worth the price.6. 170 rupees charged for limited 2 rottis.7. There is no follow up service for people who need dishes and sambhars during the dinner/lunchI would not recommend this restuarant for a peaceful meal"
4,"One of the best North karnataka restaurant in the area. Bit pricy compared to other north karnataka eateries, but better option compared to other eateries in and around kamakya. Crowded on weekends and I happen to visit on a Saturday.I happen to try the below things:1. Jolad Rotti(Jawar rotti): basic nothing special with it. Brinjal Palya was tasty. 3.5/52. Holige: we tried their Shenga holige which was average, I like the fact that it was fresh and tasty.Bele holige was prepared fresh it was good too. 4/53.mirchi bajji: good. They use fresh oil. 3.5/5My Ratings: overall 3.5/5Food: good: 3.5/5Ambience: cleaner than any other north karnataka eatery: 4/5Service: Slow. But you get the fresh food. 3/5With LoveThejaswini Mv"
4,"A simple clean and hygienic self service restaurant serving North Karnataka dishes. There are only about 8 to 10 tables and thus be prepared to wait during peak hours. Enjoyed Girmit, Holige, Sabudhana Vada among other dishes."

5,"I came across this hotel via swiggys.. never visited but the food from here has become my staple food n life saviour ! Why ? Cos I order for chapathi , sukka n fish masala fry , which makes me addicted to their food.. packaging is not upto mark , but who cares ? At the end of the day , it is taste n quality with d most reasonable price ?had to tell thanks to this restaurant .."
3.5,I had ordered fish meal. I felt curry was too much tangy. Fish was okay. Rice was provided too much in quantity since I felt curry was tangy couldn't finish it.
4,"Randmly tried ordering food , was delicious and worth the price , should definitely try to satisfy ur taste buds...the delivery was real quick as well."
4,So I accidentally stumbled upon this place on Swiggy when I was thinking of ordering something and decided to taste the food. The Biriyani was the typical South Indian Donne Biriyani with ample chicken with it. The Chicken 65 was soft and satisfied the taste buds. It's a no frills place and value for money place for non veg appetite.
5,It was delicious South Indian food cafe . Limited Menu but food is good . Can try with dosa . No soda and no artificial colours is used here.
5,"Guys , do visit the place , it is opened by my friend, tasty coffee and also the price is not so high,Place is decent and also it has good enough dishes on the menuCoffee: as the name suggests it is awesome,Tried : idly and Kharabath, Both tasted nicePlace is open in the morning:6 to 11.30And evening :4.30 to 8.30"
4,For Early morning breakfast this is the Best place to have yummy breakfast @6.30I had idli and vadaIdli were so soft and crispy vadaHad awesome filter coffeeFriendly staff's with friendly environmentOpen ambience always crowded
5,"Also commonly known as "" SLV canteen"". I've been coming here regularly for more than 10 years. Everything they serve is extremely delicious. It's my go to breakfast place. I ordered a plate of idli and vada with chutney. They were simply amazing, as always. Only drawback is that there's no proper place to sit and eat and also it gets extremely crowded in the peak hours."
4,"Been in Banashankari for months and always wondered why this place was always overcrowded until I saw it in the legendary outlets list of Zomato. Makes Sense now, the best coffee bar for South Indian breakfast in this area. There is not much a place here, so the foot path is where one has to stand and eat but once the idlis and vadas melt in your mouth, you just forget everything. They have the crispiest Vada and Dosa, taste being the usual in old Coffee bars of Bangalore. Nothing seems to have changed in years. Ambience - primarily because of food patrons - 3.5/5, price - 4/5, food - 4/5.A must-visit place for people in and around Banashankari."
4,"I've been going to this SLV for about 20 years now. The taste hasn't changed one bit. They have renovated the place recently. I love the food here. Literally everything here is good. If you want to grab a quick breakfast and don't mind waiting for your food and standing and eating, then this place is apt for you."
4,"Branded one of the LEGENDARY coffee bars in Bengaluru, this place stands for it's word. The place is usually always crowded with the localites, so make sure you're ready for that!Ambiance and Parking :It's just a small place where you have the billing counter at the left and the food counter in the middle. No place to sit / no tables around. Parking is limited to 2 wheelers in the front as it's near to the BDA complex of Banashankri.Food :All I could have is the Idly - Vada as they were out of Masala Dosas ( This does happen sometimes when they're out of the aloo stuffing )The Vada is one of the crispiest vadas I've EVER had! Idly was soft and moist. Chutney, being the traditional coconut chutney.I'm bound to visit this place soon and try all the other lip smacking food!Recommended :Vadas, Masala Dosas, Khara baath, Bisi Bele Baath Coffee."
4,"The crispy vade and chutney , soft idli and chutney , kharabath and kesribath is the really highlight of this place..if you are planning for a breakfast lesser than 100 rupees in Bangalore , this is the place which suits you..they serve the authentic cuisine breakfast of Karnataka and they are just amazing love this place to the core..Masale Dose is also one of my favorite of this place which is served with stuffing inside the dose . Must try if you haven't till now..The rating :Taste : 4.5/5Quality : 4/5Service : 3.5/5Ambiance : 3/5Price : 4/5Please do watch our videos on our YouTube channel Tummy On Fire and do not forget to like , share and subscribe .

4,"A great place with dedicated staff and effort for hygienic food with wow taste. I would recommend the maddur vada for sure, dosa were crispy with delicious masala"
5,"LEGENDARY - Don?t have time to read the review.. forget it. Just go and munch!Food / Drink - Idly, Vade, baths, doses, and.. coffee! And oh.. btw.. everything is awesome. How could you describe awesome! Tender idlies, crisply Vades and chow chow bath from outer space. Yes. You could check that!Price - Old world charm price. Inflation has pushed it up. But still.. affordable nook! Value quotient is exciting.Service - Fast. No non sense service. Chatty staff at the counter. Separate chutney counter. What?s not to like.Ambience - Brilliant. Recently expanded. But hasn?t lost its old charm. Love it.Location - Bang opposite to BDA park. Oh.. wait. The BDA park and complex are opposite to SLV!Parking - Street.Speciality - Idly + Vade + Chow Chow Bath + Coffee.Must try? - Yes! And one more Yes!Pro tip - Go hungry dude. Else, what?s the point!"
5,"Awesome place to have benne dose ,This much of taste I never had in Banglore ,No tension to park vehicles, sitting facility is there and they are using Nandini butter."
3,"Straight to the point.Ordered food from this outlet thinking it's another branch of the Davanagere dose in BEML layout, Rajarajeshwari Nagara which is outstanding.Feedback.beNNe dose - 4/5 stars. Very good dose. Recommended.Idly - 1/5 stars. A total Disaster. Not soft, dry. Just not the idly you wanted. Please work on it.Chutney - full of garlic, least expected in Coconut chutney. A total put off. Subjective, for me it's a nono.So a very good place for dose.Idly - Need to improve a lot. Just not idly.Request: Why do you add garlic to the chaste coconut chutney? Please don't do that.Rating given only for Idly and Dose. (Not chutney)"
5,This one is the best of the Benne Dose restaurant.The taste of dosas are mouth watering delicious...Reasonable price for all variety of dosas...
5,Wahhh... Its yummy Food and specially ?Open Benne Dosa? was excellent. Well quality maintained. Wants to visit again. Addicted food. #OriginalBenneDosa ??????
4,"Well, if you are a Maggi lover then this place is perfectly made for you. I had been here almost 5 to 6 weeks ego and ordered Vegetable Masala Maggi and some Paneer jeera rice sizzler, both were very well made with the way I like and spice level. Prices are pocket friendly and interiors are very well done. I recommend this place!bangaloreepicure.com"
2,"Tried their Chilly Garlic Maggi (upon asking for recommendation as the menu is super confusing) wasn't good at all. Coke was served in a glass mixed with water.Ambience is good, but the owner is too rude and doesn't care to serve/take orders.Their isn't any staff around the big hall they have, for any service. They call it a self service restaurant inspite of having a seating for about 50 people!Wouldn't recommend."
3,Located in a prime location of Banashankari. Interiors are unique & spacious. Menu has variety of dishes especially different kinds of Maggie. Taste is good. But didn't really impressed with the service. Takes too long time & the staff doesn't communicate well with the customers.
3,"The new maggi cafe in town. They have a wide variety of Maggi dishes to choose from and also the menu includes pizza , pasta , sizzlers and some coolers as well. We visited here for a evening snack , we tried the peri peri Maggi, panner sizzler which tasted good and nachos platter which was a complete let down . There were some power failure issues wen we visited the cafe. But this place is nicely decked up with pretty interiors. Will surely recommend 6th is place if u are a Maggi lover ."
5,"Messy bowl is a perfect place for long conversation with besties over Maggie in a lovely ambiance. This pocket friendly cafe in Banashankari is truly a great place.Fries lover will definitely love the butter garlic fries here.Must try: garlic fries, tandoori maggie#rajeshwrites"
5,"Amazing place! Loved the variety of Maggi available. If you are a maggi masala lover you must definitely try the Maggi soup. Additionally, loved the nachos. Ambience is good and the staff are extremely friendly. Pocket friendly place. Highly recommended :)Food-5/5Ambience-4.5/5Service-5/5Worth for money -5/5"
4,This place in Banshankari happens to be really in terms of ambience as well as the menu. If you want to experiment with Maggi You definitely have to try this place out and it'll leave you with no regrets. Its a very pocket friendly place which serves lip-smacking food. They have a lot of options. We happened to order? Nachos platter - This dish is a must try. It stood out among all the dishes. It's overloaded with cheese and salsa.? Mexican fries - Good.? Paneer chilli sizzler - Excellent. The paneer was perfectly cooked and the rice tasted really good.? Tandoori maggi - Very good.? Lasagna maggi - This dish was very different where the top layer tasted like lasagna but had flavoured Maggi when we digged into it.? Creamy burst pasta - Average.
5,"MESSY BOWL this place is for maggie lovers, they have variety of maggies, the flavours of maggie just tasted wow? they have pasta, fries others too,the cost is also reasonable. There ambience is good with nice seating and different. Friendly people but service is too slow.Fries was yummy, pasta cream tasted little sweet, the highlight was different flavours of maggies.There name may be messy bowl but they never messed with the things it was great visiting this place.Maggie lovers must visit place."
4,"Messy bowl, Banashankari is the first of its outlets in bengaluru. A neat cafe lounge located above lenskart in sidanna layout Banashankari. They have 31 flavours of Maggi. The best of the best would be the tandoori Maggi. Loved it to the core. Ginger mojito was a very good refresher with the Maggi. Also try the schezwan Maggi, paneer chilli sizzler. A very good option for a pocket friendly deliteful treat.Service - 3.5 /5Ambience - 4/5Taste - 4/5"
5,GÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå?od food.. I am one of the happy customer here. Less menu high taste. Halbai sweet is awesome. One of the best South food outlet of South bangalore.. Nice foods and tasty coffee available here..
5,"Just one word that's 'BEST'.The taste is absolutely good.The quality we expect is exactly what we get.Oil usage is not more unlike other restaurants,it's used in limit but yummy as well.From my side Vada and Masala Dosa is a must try!"
5,"Small menu, big taste. I am daily customer of this restaurant. Idly cadaver, Medu disappear, masala disappear, ravage idly, coffee all these good."
5,Very good place for south Indian food and Chinese food. Awesome coffee had here and Halbai sweet also nice. Rate also economy. I am keep going here..
3,"This is a place where we go every weekend for our breakfast , the menu is very limited and does not offer large varieties , but the taste is good , the sambar does not taste great but chutney is yum. They have sweet delicacy like halbai which is good. Try it for coffee and breakfast , it's currently under renovation..."
3,"The place sits right beside the main road and is usually filled with people drinking coffee, it also serves idly, vada , masala dosa and few more dish , it is good and VFM and is usually a place where you to have a quick bite and there is no place to sit, so you have to stand while eating, The taste of the food is okay not bad but they can improve on their sambar which is always watery. A good place to have breakfast and coffee."
4,"VFM Veg Fast food restaurant with very minimal dishes to choose for , Best place for Medu Dosa...prepared without using oil...So health concious people must try dish..Crispy Vada is another dish to try out for.Rest is OK.."
3,"It's a simple hotel, with no seating available. The dosas aren't that great. The idlis are OK. On the other hand, the beverages they serve are quite good. My personal favorite is the tea. The prices are just like any other tiffin hotels."
3.5,"This place is awesome where all can have the south Indian delicacy of food like idly, dosa, paddu etc. Must try if you are loving south Indian delicacy food. Although the items are less in the menu only breakfast items, it's worth it to try once. Ambiance is good but no sitting available and self service outlet. The prices are very reasonable and service is fast too. Hence the final verdict is to make a visit once to try best south Indian munchies."
5,"Best Idlis & Vaday's in our Kathriguppe Area, Awesome Sambar & Chuttney, Good Khali Dosay & Masale Dosay.Paddu's are also good, they make Pongal too, which am not a fan of that Dish, but the taste is goodCoffee/Tea both are good."
3,Taste was not that greatThe dosa and poori are overrated hereNot the best in townIdly is quite okI've not tried the coffeeBut I've heard people tell it's actually good
4,Food is really good and well cooked. Looks like a pretty hygienic place. Great place for breakfast and evening snacks. A place worth giving a shot. Coffee and tea is really really good here?.
4,"A quick bite that is satisfying. That's what this place is. The dosas are really good and worth it. If you're looking for a pocket friendly breakfast joint that does justice, then this is it! Try it!"
4.5,After a long walk with friends and we found this on the left. It was nearly 7pm in the night and it was crowded though. Ambience was good and the food served at the right time. Overall the place was nominal.
3,"A simple hotel which serves really good idli, vada and dosas. Self service. Great taste. Pocket friendly and a really cool place to hangout and have a bite."
3.5,"I never knew that this tiny little place had a presence on Zomato!It can be pretty hard to spot. Usually crowded. Their timings are pretty weird. Quick service. Masala dosas are really good, as are the vadas. Other items are ok. The choice is very limited, though. A few more items added to the menu would certainly make this place more appealing.Food - 3.5/5Ambiance - 2.5/5Service - 4/5Value for money - 4/5Hygiene - 3/5Overall - 3.5/5"
1,"Low cost, worst food, rude staff in this hotel. Very badly maintained hotel. Coffee is made from thin Milk. Vada is very hard. It doesn't cut in Spoon.I & my friend went after morning walk, though we were hungry, we couldn't eat in such a bad place."
1,"Only for people who look for low cost, no taste buds. Says serves traditional south Indian food, but have short menu with all items available on road side. I had medhu dosa, it's just dosa with 'dose' of soda. Paddu is still worst, we get good one near vv puram. Sour taste. Not good. Coffee is very bitter with lot of chicory. Chutney is very mild. No taste. Only low price."
2.5,New hotel in the area become famous in no time with its typical south Indian food. Apart from daily food you will get Mangalore sweet and Paddu in the evening. Small hotel with limited ready menu.
5,One of the best fast foods served in Namma bengaluru. Loved the paddu and masala Dosa there. The coffee is unbeatableThe service is also very quick and the place is kept so nice and clean.
4.5,"Been a regular here for a long time. They serve good breakfast and the menu is khali dosa, masala dosa, idly vade, kharabath. Earlier they had meals option but later discontinued. Clean and affordable. Would expect them to introduce wide range of brekafast.."
5,"This a one stop place for a quick breakfast!!I don't see anything negative about this place!! I've been here a couple of times, and the food is very tasty! The kitchen is clean and hygienic! then menu is concentrated on simple breakfast and evening bite, with very affordable prices! Comparatively this is the least expensive I've come across :-)A,must visit place if you're around to serve yourself with wonderful breakfast! :-)Cheers :-)"
3.5,"Janahaar is one of the popular quick breakfast joints in Bangalore. This is similar to By two Coffee chains with extended menu. Somehow I missed to write a review about this place although I visited several times.Janahaar has so many outlets in South Bangalore and few of their outlets are really doing debauched but this outlet is doing fairly well in respect to Service & quality.Here they serve simple breakfast like Idly Vada, Khara Bath, Kesari Bath, Masala Dosa, Khali dosa and Paddu. Every dish is really worthy and tastes countless!Must try joint for quick breakfast with cheap prices!Shouldn?t miss their Filter Coffee, tastes wonderful!bangaloreepicure.com"
4.5,Place for Medu Dosa & Hot Idlies....Janahaar's Specialty is HaalBaai ..Malnad Style Sweet ..Amazing Dish it is...Must Try ..Place is hygienic Value for Money...
3.5,The place makes good authentic dosas called medu dosas! They are the best. This place is value for money! The idlis here are also gud ! Place is quite clean and hygienic.
4.5,Wow. Visited this place for breakfast today. This is a 100% veg joint serving south indian breakfast.I was impressed by the cleanliness as soon as I saw this place. Though not huge the place is very hygienic. The menu is limited to idly vada medu dosa khara bath kesari bath and masala dosa. I had the dosa which was good. Leas oil crispy and the masala just right. The vada was crispy. The masala dosa is served with chutney and sambhar is extra charge. Now the best part. This place is highly affordable. Masala dosa costs only Rs.30/-. I really liked this place well worth the visit and money.
3.5,Tastes good ..... Try it out
4.5,Each and every item is very very testy and cheaper compared to the near by A2B.
4.5,"Janahar has good tasty veg food. options are limited though... idly vada kharabath, kesari bath and dosa ... bombat tindi for 50rs is good value since you have a bite of all avl items.... overall nice eating place in bsk 3rd stage"
4,"Plz,this is a 100% vegetarian fast food restaurant :)I'm glad I've a hygienic south Indian joint to wane ma hunger pangs.. Hot coffee,teas,badam milk... The aroma... Just perfect...The idlis,vadas are nicely made.. Kharabath is pretty ok..the kesaribath with the ghee and pineapple pieces,. Bliss:D:D... The dosas aren't bad either.. I recommend this place anyday if you wanna have a quick breakfast after jogging or probably some evening bites.. Head ya way here.. Esp if you stay in the vicinity..."
4.5,"Zomato needs to correct the info here!It's a pure veg restaurant.. I had Bombat tiffin.. It comprises of khara bath, kesari bath, idly, vada and mini masala dosa.. Moderately priced at Rs. 49..Taste wise I was really happy! Vada was crispy, khara bath and kesari bath was yummy too.. Elaichi was used really well in kesari bath.. Tasty masala dosa.. Coffee had great aroma too..Overall I'd say this is a great place for a good bite.."
4,"What: nati style biryani hotel.Where: hanumanthnagarAmbience: average.Well was at this place last weekend. Ordered chicken biryani, pepper chicken and chicken. Lollipop. The chicken biryani and lollipop was good but the pepper chicken was undecided. You can drop in once if you are around this place just to satisfy your hungers. But if you are looking into tasty delicious foods this is not the place.Maybe I might drop into this place again."
5,"Hotel chickpet Donne biryani house is the best place for biryani lover in Bangalore.Any biryani lover in Bangalore, must visit this place.Awesome taste.Finger licking good taste.Good price.Good ambiance.Very good taste"
5,Good food taste and dose and upittu is best taste and worth for payFood/Taste ? 8/10Service ? 8/10Value for Money ? 9/10Ambiance ? 9/10Quantity/Quality ? 9/10
4,"A place which is bustling with people, during peak times they have two long queuesBreakfast or evening snack in mind then this is the place to go. Idli and benne khali are the best, others are good too.It is the best place to have benne khali dosa, super spongy texture and great taste, because of the big queue you will have to decide and take all you want at once.They give tokens along with the bill to ensure first come first serve, which is a very good thing in busy places.Prices are reasonable too"
4,"One of the best places to have Khaali Dosa especially benne khaali which is very soft and light (very similar Dwaraka hotel in NR Colony). Chutney was good, masala Dosa was crisped to perfection had a nice crunch to it and of course the palya inside was pretty good and well seasoned. Vada is one of their specialties, try their compact menu which serves brilliant breakfast. They are good at managing tokens which makes sure that you won't have to wait for long periods of time in peak hours.FYI. this is not a branch of Brahmins coffee bar which is there in chamarajpet.Taste 4.5 /5Hygiene 4/5Price 4/5Serving size 4/5Service 4.5/5Ambience 3.5/5"
5,"Great place for breakfast or a quick evening snack. Speciality is Khali dosa which is one of the best and is on par with dwarka bhavan. Idli, shavige bath also good. Lot of crowd especially after they relocated to the current place."
5,"A new hotel which can give a good competition for the other darshinis. A self service outlet, but has a few seats to sit on the outside.When you enter, all you can see is people carrying plates of Khali dosa. So we couldn't resist ordering one, but ended up having 3 plates. The dosas are soft, fluffy and delicious. Don't forget to order with butter. It enhances the taste.The uniqueness of this hotel is they serve 2 varieties of chutney. One specifically for the dosas, the other for idli, vada etc.I also loved the shavige bath(veg spicy rice noodles).Ending our food with coffee, which was perfect for our liking. They also serve ginger coffee (Didn't get to try this time).Definitely a must visit for morning and evening snacks. Fills stomach for 2 in less than ?150."
5,This is the best place to have Pongal in banshankri. Pongal and it's called as Tirupathi Pongal and it is served with curd raitha.. I regularly visit twice in a week..
4,"Zomato delivery was super fast and food delivered super hot inspite of the distance... The food was tasty, well packed, well prepared, correct price and above all brings a smile of satisfaction... Good job BCH.... Loved and enjoyed every bite of your food.... Will be back again soon..."
4,"being unwell I don't feel like eating anything and who wants to eat food from the hostel mess, idli was the only option. Bengaluru coffee house delivered Amazing idlis at very cheap cost, however ?30 tax was added which doubled the cost of idli. thank you to Zomato offers I got reasonable discount."
4,I like the coffee here ... the masala dosa is good !It?s a bit crowded in the evenings.but a really nice place to stop by and enjoy some good coffee.The chaats aren?t great
5,"Food here is very well priced. They serve a lot of items - chaats, South Indian and Chinese food here as well. Tried Gobi Manchurian, fried rice, kesari bhath and neer dosa. Taste of all of them is pretty good. Service here is usually fast. They accept paytm as payment method as well."
5,People who are always on the hunt for biryanis with perfect spice balances must give a compulsory visit to the biryani cafe near Avalahalli BDA Park.Any spice can be felt best only if with marination and any dish which come to the table here undergoes a 4 hour marination process.The unique combination of spices makes this place very unique.Must try: Paneer fry and mint cooler#rajeshwrites
4,"I have been here once and I tried chicken Basmati biryani the taste was good close to Hyderabadi Biryani but the gravy was not good, ambiance is ok."
5,A hidden gem serving the best Donne Biryani in town. I should say this has been the best Donne Biryani I have had till date. In fact I?m tempted to go back and give a low rating to some of the other Donne Biryani restaurants.The Biryani Cafe Chicken Fry is an excellent starter and a very unique dish. Crispy and hard on the outside and gets soft and juicy as you bite in. Just the right amount of spicy and this starter goes well with the Pudina Juice.Donne Biryani is cooked to perfection; the rice is cooked just well and the chicken pieces are softer and juicy. A must have dish at this restaurant.The Dum Biryani was just on and I should say is not as tasty as the Donne Biryani.The ambience takes you to old Bangalore with one wall adorned with pictures of the city in the early 70?s I guess. Service is great and enjoyable.
4,Haven?t been to the restaurant but have ordered online many timesThe Biryani is Authentic Karnataka style with the right amount of flavour and spice served that a light onion raitha they also have different variety of biryani (Basmati)My favourite are jeer rice Biryani and The egg chilliDecent pricePocket friendlyCheers to the whole team ????????
4,"I went to this place in search of kothu poratta, but when we reached they were like they don?t have kothu poratta, I was really disappointed and my friend told the thing , and they prepared it for us , the staffs were really good and I was happy , it was really goood , and plus damn spicy, authentic kothu poratta??Loved every bit of it , never miss out on this"
3,"Highly recommended by a friend, this cafe is situated within the streets of banashankari. The ambience is pretty decent and has a rustic tinge of the past. The food was good. I had ordered paneer special fry. The paneer was fried and roasted in butter. The taste was unexpected and completely new to me. The buttery taste with a slight sour flavor was slightly weird and nice at the same time. I would recommend this place for chicken (which my friend had) and mushroom fry, which is supposed to be delicious here."
4,cost for chicken rolls is very high but fine taste by pandey and is crew. pls deduct the cost of rolls and great variety of food is been served
5,"Awesome taste, feel rich taste of food, cleanness is very good, very friendly nature by the hotel person, totally awesome, all the best gud luck"
4,Great food and proper Karnataka style full meals. Been there twice and was fully satisfied.. Will give 5 stars if it's well managed............
2,Reached the place at 3pm on Saturday. Half of the items on the menu were over. What was annoying was is the food was cold. The taste was also very average. Only dosa and holige were good. There were very few people in the restaurant and the service was still very slow. The waiters were all standing in one corner and talking. Had to call them repeatedly.
4,"Had been here, good food served and tasty,good place to go with freinds and family, should be first to get served well with all food. One of the good hotel there for this price."
2,"How can a Udupi restaurant be so dirty.the floor the walls the waiters are all stained in food.Why cant they clean it? The floor even had decorative colour paper every where and lot of food.Now coming to the taste of the food- it was pretty decent for what they chargw.What upset us was the menu says they serve thambuli, two variety of rice etc but they were all over at 2.45 but they still charged us full amount.Lastly if u r ok to b seated with random people and adjust with their table manners( burrping etc) then tis place is decent for a quick veg udupi meals"
4,Aadhuri Udupi bhojana is one of the best vegetarian hotel in and around Banashankari localitywere we can enjoy the authentic south Karnataka style food.
5,One of the best restaurants for unlimited food. Price for one full unlimited meal is ?150 and the service is awesome here. If you?re a costalian you will love the food served here.
4,"Been here a couple of times. Highly satisfying on both the ocassions. Great food. Decent service. At price of 160 per person it is of a great value. The staff here serves in a traditional Mysore style dresses. The food is authentic Karnataka meals. I really liked the pineapple pickle/chutney. They serve some 4 varities of rice of which you shouldn't try all as you would already be full. Roti, Dosa were decent. In the deserts, Payasam& Holige were good.I think it is one the must try places to try some authentic south food even if you have been to the likes of Kamath etc. this one is a little different. :)"
5,Very good restorent good south Indian food very nice all food s are good we spent good time and food in this hotel value of money we loved it
3.5,I went to this restaurant on Sunday afternoon.It was a bit crowded.Its located in the 1st floor Above anna kuteera kathriguppeYou need to take food coupon in the ground floor itself.it was 160 rs.Taste wise it was good.Service was slow.Nothing exciting/different in the menu.Whatever they serve its good.Worth for money.
5,"Awesome place , worth with price , quality , quantity , service , hygiene and discipline I loved it ???? wish there were more rating stars to give I give 100 on 5 for sure"
3.5,"Nice food, good ambiance, so many verity of food, this time i was in hurry so, next review will be detailed one. Its good to see all dishes at one place"
1.5,The food was not satisfactory. Not one item served could be eaten again . Only advantage is the price but even that is not going to be enough to make me visit the place again . Dear Udupi staff people wouldn?t mind if the food quality was better for a higher price and please get more fans so that people won?t have to deal with another disappointment of sweating while eating.
5,"Excellent quality and taste, more variety of authentic south Indian food. Excellent service. Highly recommended. Worth the money we pay here."
2,"I'm rating 2 only because of the large number of items they serve for the price they charge. While the taste is moderate, the biggest turn off is the poor service and totally unresponsive staff. They are either understaffed or poorly trained. I didn't get to taste a few items, thanks to their ever busy staff, and ended eating what was served. Please learn the crowd management from other peers like maiyya and roti ghar"
5,"One of my colleagues suggested this place. Went there at 1 pm and place wasnt crowded. Ambience is decent and cool. A welcome drink ""appekai saru"" was served. Then started..typical ""baale yele uta"" . Diffrerent types of palya, kosambari and sides. Then came masala dosa, pulka,pulav, veg rice bath. Masala dosa was very very tasty. Service is bit fast as people will be coming, but they will make it slow if u tell them to. Then comes rice with sambar,rasam, daal,tambali. And yes, dont forget to eat holige,payasam and icecream. Service is very nice. One best thing is all of this comes in just 160 rs and its unlimited!!! What else you want!! A must visit place for south indian foodie!"
3,Been here last week with high expectations based on few reviews. But utterly disappointed with the food quality & taste. I feel it's an overhyped place! There are many better places in the vicinity for Plantain leaf meal. There was too much of waiting & these staffs were too hurry in serving food & asking people to finish meal & leave quickly. I can understand there is a waiting and staffs should approach in a positive way. I will never go there again!bangaloreepicure.com
4,"I have a confession, being a south Indian I distaste south Indian food(not that I hate it, I don't like it either).But still made up my mind on Sankaranti to have authentic south Indian food visited ""Adduri Udupi Bhojana"" because it was close to my place.I just had a look at the menu told myself that I can do it(I am not blessed with a tremendous appetite).welcomed with the mango soup followed by the wide variety of dishes served, I have developed the new love for Pongal(both sweet and Khara).I can still feel the taste of the ghee bursting in my mouth but it was""kai holige"" that made my day, crisp and soft.not to forget food is served on a banana leaf that adds in more flavor and taste.waiters are attentive and responsive.The customer's needs are monitored and addressed.so much variety for just 160Rs without compromising on quantity and quality and yes it is unlimited.This visit turned out to be a surprise package."
3.5,Food is good.No parkingAmbience is averageOverall its value for money if you looking for south Indian food.Preferred the tiffin items......
4,Had been on a week night for an authentic south Indian food. I personally love being served on banyan leaf. The waiters are all dressed up in traditional Mysore attire wearing with a peta. The food was delicious and definitely worth it's price. The waiters are friendly and serve u well with a smile. The food is prepared without garlic which is a plus point attracting many senior customers.
3.5,"Food is good and enjoyed. With 150 Rs. is very nice.Note: (It happen with us) - If you going TWO people, you may need to share the table there. Its almost crowed. - You have to sit where they ask, you can't choose even if all the table are empty. Just wait, eat and come back."
5,Excellent Ambience with delicious meals with 10-15 variety types. Worth paying for money and you can dine out if you are with more friends/relatives in home.
4.5,Very good and Unlimited . especially masala dosa . Service and ambience was also good. will visit again with friends . very very reasonble and wholesome food
3.5,"Aaaa wt to tell, Unlimited food, food was like exactly like south indian marriage food, 2 soups, sides masala dosa, all were unlimited for just ?150, except ice cream in the end ?? they give a water bottle, and main thing is have patience to get place to sit..... ??,there is no parking place of this outlet, and difficult to park in front of the restaurants,"
1,lack of quantity and quality too

1,not received vade they sent two small Puri
1,"order pudi idli , button idli and kesari bath quantity is very less this all three item eaten by one person if you want to order more quantity"
3,"It was a unexpected turn I made into the restaurant had zero expectations but was nice to see as the place was good and with tranquility as it is in front of a famous park in the vicinity. Now coming to the food it was good and reasonable we had ordered a masala dosa and a onion dosa , which was actually good , I would recommend to visit this place for occasional breakfast."
4,"One of the oldest hotel in town , serving best food since 1990 , they serve excellent kali dosa & bisibele bath . We are very regular to this hotel since 1 year , this place is best for yummy South Indian breakfast ."
4,"For the best Khali Dosa in South Bangalore, Hotel Mangala stands out as one among the top two. This is a very old joint and known for the Rave Vade, Khali Dosa and watery chutney.There is a way to eat Khali Dosa if you really want to savour the taste; dip the Dosa completely in the watery chutney and that?s the way.Don?t care about ambience, the attitude of the owner and staff. Just go and enjoy the Dosa."
3,"Fuss free, economical breakfast joint. We tried the Kharabath, Maddur Vada, Masala Dosa and coffee. ( Total Cost INR 65) Everything tasted good. You won?t go wow tasting the items but definitely worth the pricing."
4,Simple thindies as the name has a simple menu. A small eatery in Girinagara. Idli vada with the sambar is something that is really good here . On Saturdays don't miss their mandakki. Masala Dosa is crisp and is a lot better than it used to be. Over all it is a decent place to visit for a breakfast.
4,It is a small simple.. eating place in girinagar.. serving limited tyoes of food. But definitely delicious one. I dont know wat these things are called in Bangalore. But in my language i had a medu wada.. and a mirchi bhajiya.. really tasty.. simple and sweet (Not the mirchi though?).
3.5,"Simple Thindies is just a stone throw away from my home. It is a small and clean eatery. The owner is a very kind person. The menu is limited and the food tastes good. Girinagar really required this kind of an eatery.They serve Idli, Vada, Masale dose, chow chow bath and filter coffee. The idli vada is really tasty with the sambar and I personally didn't like their chutney. The sambar is spicy and yum! Sometimes, the Vada becomes too oily, but is good most of the times.The masala dose here is okayish, and I usually don't prefer eating it here, as I prefer idli vada all the time. The dosa could be done better.They have an evening snack, which I haven't tried yet.Taste - 3.5/5Overall - 3.5/5"
4,Located just behind the BMS college of EngineeringThis place is crowded during lunch time by college studentYou get combos which is awesome
3,"Decent rolls, really good momos and other starters items. The staff is okay and so is the place. It's small but its nice and clean. The rolls are made really well and to order. It was okay before but now theyve just made it expensive and not quite worth the price they're kept at."
4,"Been here many times so thot of adding a review. Not a posh place at all but located in great located near Banashankari BDA complex. Price is reasonable and taste is decent nothing special about the restaurant and food. Over all, A decent place."
2,"Hi,We had masala puri, sev puri and mix chats at this restaurant recently. I must say the taste of mix chat at around 8-10 yrs back was amazing and i would always request my parents to take me to this hotel and get me a mix chats because that was something unique at that time. But now the taste of all the chats were not at all good. It is a self service restaurant and the service was quick. There is also some place to sit and have your food. Parking shouldn't be a problem for a two wheeler."
4.5,"Upahar sagar is always a nice place to savour South Indian cuisines and a recommended one when you are nearby. They have got an open kitchen where you could see how are they preparing your food. The ambiance is quite okay. And apart from the south Indian cuisines they have got a other varied dishes and beverages.We had been there for a quick breakfast, and ordered for bisi bele bath and chow chow bath which turned out to be good. The service is quite fast when uncrowded."
4,"I'm a regular visitor to this place.It's my go to place for any fast grab meal.Their north Indian dishes are very tasty. Chats are also delicious.Their south Indian dishes, dosas are very crispy and tasty.I have literally tried everything on their menu.If you're in a hurry and ready to compromise on extremely good ambience for tasty food, pocket friendly this is the place to go to."
5,My all time instant visit place. The only place I've not got bored visiting though I go daily. And all the items here are so tastey yummy. One should not miss to visit to taste best flavors of each dish
4,This place is close to my office about 5 to 10 Min walk.I Have been here many times for lunch. And few times for breakfast. Masala dosa here is crispy and yummy.So this time i wanted to try something different during lunch.my friend suggested to try triple fried rice here and Luckily i saw triple fried rice on the Menu board and ordered it.It was yummy. It is combination of noodles and fried rice.However noodles will be thin and crispy. For every spoon you get crispy noodles which i liked it pretty much. They don't accept cards and little crowded during lunch time. It is Pocket friendly.recommended for casual breakfast and lunch.
4.5,This has been among one of the earliest eateries (initially known as the darshinis) in banashankari. Foodwise good and has been my go to place for breakfast and sometimes for lunch and dinner. Masala dosa is good and is crispy. Usually I take paneer tikka Masala and kulcha and is good as well.All in all a great place to have a quick eat and not heavy on the pocket as well.
1,"1)If you're looking to dine for a special occasion, this is not your place.2) It's self service system.3)Food is satisfactory ( I mean good, but not that good).4) Hotel staff not that great(Now the worst on Oct-17). Some of them just have a lot of attitude.5) Cons: Don't accept cash cards.6) Had a bad experience over here one time.I had asked for a Raitha because I ordered Veg Biryani, they had a very unpleasant attitude. At last they denied of giving me one, saying Raitha doesn't come with a Biryani here."
4,"I have been going to this place for like 5-6 days, actually I have started working nearby. So it's the only good food outlet in that area. I have tried many dishes basically puri (3 in no.) with South Indian chutney and cheese sandwich. I have tried rava dosa. Also orange juice and sweet lime soda. Food is really good and fairly priced. Basically you will find only corporate people around during lunch hours.Serve time is very fast. You have to take the bill first and food later. They have self service. Sitting facilities are properly provided. But during rush hours, people also stand outside near trees and tables kept.Overall good place."
4.5,"I stay very close to this restaurant.Whenever there is no cooked food at home,this will be at our top list for hotel food.Its has very good food with reasonable rates.Earlier many food items taste had to be improved wherein now,it is really doing good with food supply and quality.Its a self service jotel with ample seating facility.At noon,it will be so crowded as South and North Indian meals are available at very low cost with awesome quality.It Indeed fills anyone's stomach rather opting for a fine line restaurant.I love this place for Madila Dosa !!! And yes Dal fry tastes good here.Jeera rice too !!!! Many to pen down.An overall good place for foodies who stay nearby KR Road :)"
3,"As this is located very near to my office, we often used to go here for lunch or snacks.Place is ok when you don't have much options, Not so great food.Food: 3.0Ambiance: 3.0Service: Self service :)"
3,"This place used to serve amazing food earlier. However now the quality has come down a lil. Anyway, still worth visiting for a quick bite with a reasonable price."
3.5,Upahara Sagar is just down the road and the restaurant is perfect for Idli and vada. Especially the vada here is very crispy and handful. Their chutney is really authentic and so is sambar compared to other restaurants.  Other food in the menu is also good but nothing extra ordinary.
3,"A typical darshini style restaurant in KR road. The menu covers a variety of dishes and everything is just above average and not the best. Their Jeera rice is good , otherwise an average hotel. Can have once in a while..."
3,"Have not been here several times. Ordered a rava dosa once late evening, and it was pathetically oily. There was oil dripping from the dosa, and it did not taste or look like a rava dosa either. My friend who had some special stuffed dosa from the dosa counter in the front had a better experience."
4,"What do i say about this place?1. Its near by my office(0.5 km). Its more or less like a lunch out place for me.2. Its basically on the KR road, near the shastry bakery signal.Mind you, its heavily crowded place(especially during the lunch hours). The biryani, fried rice, gobi manchuri over here is good. The desserts there are quite yum. I love the north indian thali which gives you soup, cups of rice, curd rice, 3 curries, 2 rotis/kulchas, fruit salad, gulab jamun(one of the best), tomato soup for 90 bucks! and the taste doesn't disappoint you :)Comparatively small place, service is ok(you have to wait when the place is crowded and you dont get your orders on time), worth visiting 'n' number of times where 'n' is a very large number! :)Service: 3/5Food: 4.5/5Ambiance: 3.5/5"
3,One of the few darshini in the long stretch of KR road.....after Krishna grand this is the only other restaurant serving south Indian food ...in this stretch of the road......its an old restaurant with lot of management changes......the current management seems pretty decent......they are serving pretty good quality of food with some interesting combo offers too......prices are quite low .......there isn't much of an ambience ....its a self service restaurant.......if your looking for a darshini that is cheap and serves good quality of food in this KR road stretch u can definitely visit this place........
3,This hotel has been there since as long as I can remember.  I used to come here when I was a little kid. The management has changed since.This is a self service darshini type hotel with seating arrangements. The waiters serve the food to car parking space right in front of this hotel where people sit inside their cars and enjoy the food.I usually order Either North Indian or Indo-Chinese dishes from here. All the dishes here are above average and pocket friendly. Chats and jucies are pretty average and nothing exceptional. They have started 99 variety dose stall a few days ago. I will try them and update the review ASAP.
3.5,"Have been regular to this place from the time they started, This place is situated opposite to shastry's bakery, On KR Road..PARKING: Parking will not be a problem since they have space to accommodate few bikes and cars.AMBIENCE: This place is a single floor setup with stand and eat, with a few tables and chairs as well as car service option... Place is clean..FOOD: They provide south Indian, north Indian and Chinese dishes along with chats and juice. In particular south indian breakfast items, Rotis and curries are pretty good..Food is decent.. They have combos too..SERVICE & COST: Service is quick and dishes are reasonably priced.."
3.5,"Upahara Sagar is a decent South Indian restaurant in KR Road. It?s a typical Darshini style restaurant with ample varieties of south Indian dishes and some minimal north Indian dishes for lunch & dinner. I have been to this restaurant a couple of time for breakfast and lunch and impressed with the food quality and taste!During my visits taste was consistent with zero complaints and most of the dishes they serve in breakfast menu are quite decent without burning your pockets. There is no point of mentioning about particular dishes to try here, everything is virtuous. It?s a self-service restaurant with a couple of tables & chairs to sit and eat.There is nothing special about ambience here; it looks similar to other Darshini?s in Bangalore.If you are in KR road don?t think out for second thought, do visit this restaurant for breakfast!Overall:Quality: 3.5/5Taste: 3.5/5Ambiance: 3.5/5VFM: 4/5bangaloreepicure.com"
1,Took a parcel of couple of Gobi Manchurian today only to find it all stale by the time we started to have it half an hour later. Had to throw away the entire parcel as going back was not an option. It was horrible experience tasting that stale piece.
3,"A quick option in nearby areas. South Indian food are quite good. An old restaurant serving us since school days :P . Parking is a bit difficult. Thali needs some variety. Management keeps on changing, one of the waiter was too rude?"
3,"It's not worth the money, and I guess they add tasting powder to food. be careful if you're allergic to it."
4.5,"What can I say about this restaurant. Amazing, not the one for people who expect decor, its for people who relish food for an affordable price. Good kundapura food. We tasted anything and everything from seer fish,masala fry kori roti ragi mudde with curry and prawns fry was the best.Simply awesome and what would cost a bomb close close to 5k costed just 2.4kYou should try this for good kundapura food ,the local one"
4,The place is good for sea food and to fine in its nly suitable for bachelors as family's won't like the environment. Nice place to pack food back home .good service and quality food
2,"I ordered for South Meals. But, I been delivered with North meals at ?35 extra. I had to pay extra and take North meal as I had already paid in advance for south meals. isn?t this awesome!So, not worth ordering again!"
1,Really upset with the quality of biryani I got lumps of masalaSeemed like they didn't had food to pack as I ordered late yet the order got confirmed...........
3,"I orderd a veg noodles, mushroom fried rice and veg fried rice from this resturent. Delivery was on time packing is also good when i started having noodles it i feel like oily but i thought yeah little bit oil needs to make it but i turned it into different utensil. The oil is floating like water and then i didn't had a single bite also. Just the oil was problm. The other two items veg and mushroom fried rice was good. So, i rate it as 3 star."
2,taste was not good
1,Very bad experience in chicken hunt and not gud taste n quality don't order in this restorunt..i ordered lemon bone less chicken but he sent bone chicken after that no response from resturent
2,Checking wid d reviews I thought dt d food would be good .. But I was really disappointed wid d quality of d food wch was served to me..I really hope that thy improve their food quality ..
4,Have been a regular visitor here since many years and I have been disappointed only once in all these years(the gravy dishes were a bit too spicy on that particular day.) However that was a very long time back and I have had no issues ever since. Love their dry items and roast chicken. Their schezwan chicken fried rice and chicken manchurian are really good.(Fair warning... schezwan fried rices are bit on the spicier side so might not be liked by all)  They have not had home delivery service for a very long time but have started recently which is why I give them an extra 0.5(for convenience ;)) Ambience is not good. However great value for money!The quality had gone down in the middle.. but off late the taste is back to it's original glory. Wanted to rate it a 3.5 but rounding off to 4
2.5,"The Kababs & Grill chicken here are good.But,seating is an issue.This restaurant is on 100 ft road with open kitchen.i doubt that food served isn't hygenic."
3,"It has a Dabha kind of look , I've been here many times. Biriyani is not tasteless. Only thing worth trying is chicken tandoori and Kalmi. Other than that , nothing is great about this place ."
3,"Hold on to your hat, folks! I'm still a vegetarian, and yeah, I did dine here! Was just strolling around the area, and just dropped in to see if I could have a bite. Turns out, they do have some vegetarian options!There was a bit of a crowd, since it was a Sunday night. I felt quite awkward when I ordered a veg Biryani, since this place is so focussed on non-vegetarian food. There are very few tables here, which is a bummer.I got my Biryanai, and for just ?75, the quantity was REALLY large! Great value for money, to be honest. In fact, I could only consume around 60% of it, in spite of being famished! The quality was above average, but nothing great. The place could do with more seating, though.Food - 3/5Ambiance - 2/5Service - 3.5/5Value for money - 4.5/5Hygiene - 2.5/5Overall - 3/5"
3,Horrible food. Only tandoori chicken is worth it for the price. All other items have too much colour or rather tasteless. I would recommend going there only on a tight budget and you want chicken desperately.
1,Chicken huntttttt chucken huntttttt from so many days I was planing to be there but finally to day I went there nice place... but for less price we can have food but not good food not so good also bad...
4.5,Truly the best restaurant to have tandoori items! Ambience isn't that great as its a self service restaurant! But nothing beats their food quality and quantity at this reasonable price! I would say take away from this restaurant is the best option!
3,It was good with dhaba style. Afternoon time it was kinda hot because of open area!! Its little hard to hunt the place. I rate it 2.5 out of 5.. :)
4.5,I am a regular here and not even once have I been disapointed with their food.Don't expect much on the ambiance. It is a very simple self service joint. The rating I have given is solely for their food. Their prices are very affordable and is completely student friendly.The only one thing that lacks in this place is home delivery. They mention 'free home delivery' but not once have I got to talk to them over the phone. They never pick up! Management I hope you look into this matter.I recommend some of my favorties mentioned below -the chicken dum biryaninorth Indian dishes both breads and gravytriple fried ricechicken friend ricetandoori chicken
3,"Veggies are unfortunate for a place like this. The rowing kebabs and tandoors' just make you feel more hungry. The more you eat more you are satisfied. It may be a Dhaba short of place, but a perfect chicken ???? hang out place."
1,This place is horrible than a street food stall.... Sub standard quality of chicken. Avoid this place.
3.5,Chicken Items Is Sooooo Good Try It Guys
3,Not a good place.food not upto the taste and ambience don't expect any thing
1,We really need canine teeth to bite chicken hunt non veg items.... he will wind up soon....if he doesn't take my feedback consciously.
3.5,"Chicken Hunt is more of a small road side ""dhaba"". Food is tasty and it doesn't burn your pocket. So its a good place when you are damn hungry and want to just have food like a foodie."
3,"Have to ask the Owner / Cashier, why they named it ""Chicken Hunt""? Is it by design or did the designer (read 'painter') design it wrongly. This is 'darshini' style non veg joint....pre-pay the cashier, hand over the order at the counter, wait....wait...wait....wait..., your order is called, jostle for elbow space at the tall tables...gobble, gobble, gobble....go.What you need to do, is to get your order ""purrfect"" at the first instance i.e. number of dishes + number of rotis; else you are stranded and would have to join the aforementioned process queue.The food is quite good for the price and I would definitely go there again when the angst for some chicken tickles the brain."
4.5,simple place and awesome food but really at a good price. trust me I am a regular customer.
2.5,"Initially it was really good when someone from mangalore or udupi managed it.Now, you dont get the same dishes which you were getting before. Now all people from Bengal/ other Northern state preparing typical mangalorian dishes and obviously you cant find the same taste.And, vegetarian dishes is prepared on the same utensils which they use for making non-veg dishes . Yeah- name is chicken hunt. As my wife is pure vegetarian, i took her once and asked them for veg dishes. They prepared with same oil/utensils which they were not supposed to.Now the price has increased from initial stage. But it is really reasonable. Tandoor dishes are also reasonable. These days, I prefer Biriyani paradise (bunts) near Bank Colony. Better taste and more cleanliness !Initially i was loving this place. Not any more !"
3.5,"The food is quite good for the price. Butter chicken, Punjabi chicken and tandoori are my favorite. As said earlier it gets crowded especially in the evenings on weekends, you may have to wait to get a chair. This place is not for people who crave for ambiance, Its definitely worth a try."
4,"Small and sweet place, but awesome chicken! Can get crowded during peak hours, but this is real street chicken food! Don't expect too much.. you will not get better chicken dishes for the same price anywhere else! If you're ready to sit on plastic chairs in the open to eat great chicken, this is the place for you! Kebabs, Tandoori and Grilled chicken are the best! I recommend Reshmi and Zafrani Kebab! Chinese dishes aren't too bad either!"
4,Been here since its inception. A decent place run by a guy who previously used to make bajjis and bondas in the same neighbourhood.You get fresh served south Indian dishes in the morning and they make amazing sambar I tell.The best part being that they make benne masala dosa (Butter Masala Dosa) and damn he does it great.Apart from this in the noon they serve meals which are pretty decent for the price and have tried it about 3-4 times.In the evening they make Chinese dishes which are really well prepared and I am always visiting the place for breakfast and almost every Sunday??.They also make these specialty food like mangalore buns and other desserts like halwas which are good try as well .They have both standing and sitting options and the food is worth the price.Only thing I'm hoping for is for delivery options which would make it better.
3,"Pretty average as compared to the other branches. The ambiance is much better compared to other branches. Service is good! The taste again is average. The pricing is fine.Also, for more updates follow us on Instagram using the handle justbangaloring!"
3,"This place is located near BMS hostel, and trust me I had no plans on going here but since my friends insisted I had to take the risk but trust me it was worth it.The service was extremely fast coming to the food the biryani was amazing something different, the hot hot kebabs and the hot parotas with the curry was niceAmbience:2/5Food:3/5Price:4/5"
4,Butter chicken with rice... Taste was good !!! Try it guys... Also try Biryani it tastes really good also... The chicken was cooked nicely and was so soft..
3,Went here for lunch today and the place was almost packed. One good thing that I liked about here is that they have entrance through both sides. Seating can be a bit cramped and the service is fast coz of the small space. I ordered the mutton biryani and my friend ordered white rice and pepper chicken. The Biriyani was well cooked and there were good pieces of mutton in it. Cooked properly as well. The pepper chicken was also pretty spicy and tasted quite nice as well. The only reason why the rating is a bit low is coz of the space issue. Pricing is also kind of fair and does not damage your pocket so much ?
1.5,Not Great taste for the food i had.
5,"The medu vada is incredible, extremely crisp outside and a soft inside. The getti chutney also was really tasty. A definite must visit joint. The idlis as well are really soft."
2,"What prompted me to visit this place? A discussion on twitter over best idly vada outlets in the city! This was one of the highly rated outlets. This one room humble joint has nothing great to offer. Far from being the best, idly vada was just the usual fare. Chutney was just k. Sambar was outright bad. I decided not to order anything more. Divesh Thaploo"
5,"best place till date to have idli and chutney in Bangalore, they have idli chutney, masala dosa with chutney, kesari bath, khara bath, ghee rice, tea , coffee, milk etc. it is located near banshankari bda complex and whenever i have visited it in the moring, its always full. There is a queue for coupons, then you stand in the respective queue what you want, also if you want extra chutney a guy sits outside only so you don't have to go in the queue again. A must visit place in bangalore."
4,"If you want to have breakfast below 100 rupees , this is the right place you will be looking at as this place serves lots of good authentic Karnataka style cuisine for breakfast like Masale Dose , idli chutney and vade chutney . Also the kharabath and kesribath . This is what I eat everytime I go there..the most favorite dish I like here is the idli and why I love the most is the softness of the idli is really good and perfectly cooked and served with the most delicious chutney though its consistency is very thin , it tastes really good with the idli and kharabath and accompanies best with the vade..must try place if you haven't tried it..The rating :Taste : 4.5/5Quality : 4.5/5Ambiance : 3/5Service : 3.5/5Price : 4.5/5Please do watch our videos on our YouTube channel Tummy On Fire and do not forget to like , share and subscribe . Please do follow our page Tummy On Fire on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.."
4,"My early morning favorite joint to have hot breakfast. Typical South Bengaluru ambience where you see a lot of elderly people come everyday after their morning walk. It is located just opposite to the Banashankari BDA park.Idly - yumvade - yumchowchow bath - yummasale dose - yumchutney - yum yum ?It's a locals favorite. If you haven't been here, give it a try, you will love it."
3,They don't do chapati as mentioned above anymore. The idly batter was watery and the idly was slightly rubbery to chew on. I think the competition has moved on and is better.
4.5,Mouth watering food !! Stricly for vegiteraincez...Really awesome                     Dont miss                                                                                                                                      banshakari
4,If you are looking for pure south Indian authentic food in Bengaluru then this place is amazing. My first visit to Bengaluru and first restaurant in the city and really happy with the food. One suggestion for everyone please wait till last dish to come because they have good variety in buffet.
3,"Centrally located restaurant,Reasonably priced menu,fairly decorated atmosphere Average quality food and poor service .Should increase quality and variety of food"
4,"they serve authentic kannada/ iyangar style food which very tasty and good and neat.it's simple menu, fills stomach and it's unlimited. guys with good appetite will enjoy the food..they serve only in lunch hours and not for dinner"
3,Decent place for a South Indian food... it?s quite economical and the service is also good... u always find a place... do drop in if u r in mood for simple South Indian without wasting much of time and money... service has become pathetic... they won?t even respond if u call
2.5,"Decent Roof Top ambience.Taste of the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't quite exquisite/authentic either - We have certainly had tastier South Indian meals elsewhere. Restaurant wasn't even half full on a Saturday afternoon.All in all, there's nothing exceptional about this place."
1.5,Doesn't offer what is marketedServes you cold dry food for which is superior be a lunch only place ( thali )Not good on taste quality and and priced heavy2 overallNo recommendation
3.5,"Good location, wish they put the fans on when they saw their customers sweating. Food was good south indian food with mild spice levels. Service was good as well but sometimes they would put food for only some people at the table and not ask the others."
1,"This second floor restaurant has a vast space, comfortable seating. The place has no breeze even though it is a rooftop restaurant. They do not even have good fans, we were sweating throughout the course of our eating. All side dishes were pathetic except one kurma for the late arrival poories. The rice was gastric flavoured, the service was so pathetic that the guys were asking for a translation for every dish needed. The management was rubbish."
4,"Had visited this place on a Sunday afternoon (30th April 2017) and found it sparingly occupied at 2pm.I think food prepared here changes daily and depends on the day. We were served beetroot palya, heerekai kootu, kosambari,chutney,chapati,puliyogere,chilly bajji, papad,curd,buttermilk,shavige paaysa,rice,rasam,sambar and majjige huli.The only thing that was not good was the chilly bajji as it was cold and it was bit oily. Rest of the items were very good. All the items clearly tasted like home cooked food.Service was also good and didn't feel it was slow. They property attended to serve when items were getting empty."
3.5,"This indeed was a pleasant surprise. Probably the best of the lot in BSK 2nd stage for vegetarian meal. Ambience is simple and nice. The poori and saagu was the highlight of the meal. I got to know that generally they serve chapathis but the day we went they had pooris. The Huli(Sambar) was very good. Saaru(Rasam) could have been better. Shavige payasa, Happala(papad), mensinkai bajji(mirchi) were all good too. Food served on plantain leaf is always a delight. Definitely a winner on hand"
3,"The food is good, not very great but totally worth the price. If you not very particular about authentic South Indian then you can try the place otherwise it might turn out to be a little disappointing."
2.5,"Leaves you with a very unfulfilling experience with expecting a lot more from this restaurant because of its location and it is advertisement of cuisine. Bad service. Hardly anyone asks what u need. Average cuisine, average service... location is good but not so good food quality and dining experience."
3.5,"Nice place to have south Indian meals . nice rooftop ambience. The staff served us well. We were served on a plantain leaf. This place is located above hara , near the banashabkari bda complex."
3.5,Kidambi's Kitchen a rooftop restaurant. You get tat refreshing feel when you enter the restaurant. Traditional south Indian meals served on plaintain leaf. The food was good. The service was good n the staff was friendly too. The meal is unlimited. Value for your money and last but not the least the desert was awsm :-)
2,Good place. Good food but service was bad. Each item had to be asked several times. No personalized attention given. We were made to wait for the dessert. Finally had to cancel. On the whole an average experience. Worth visiting once only.
2,A big mistake going here yet knowing that hara is no more good now....would request you to avoid this one...there was non where I could say was good or worth for what you are paying for...the worst lunch I had in my life...you can easily get a better one for lesser price near by....it was a hot afternoon and they have only 2 fans...taste of food was a disaster...not worth a penny...
4,This is a roof top lunch restaurant.I liked the decorTradition meals served on a banana leaf.Food is Homely.The meal served here is Traditional karnataka food.
4.5,Lovely North Indian food...best for the money too heavy for two to order anything....but the taste is the best....they don't use any tasting powder or soda so it's the best place to visit at anytime....so makes me feel homely
1,"This is probably the most run down south Indian food you can eat. Stark contrast to Hara(in same premises) which makes excellent North Indian food. I think if a Darjeeling cook makes South Indian food this is how it'll be. The poori was like papad, and broke like one."
4,Lets start from the bottom. For dessert I liked the pumkin keer. The thali was amazing they had a good variety of  dishes in it. I liked the fact that they served it on a plantain leaf. It felt a lot more authentic and delicious.
2.5,I went to this place when it had started newly. Place was neat and clean and the staff friendly. The place did not have fans and it was pretty hot. The food was too bland for me. It was not at all spicy. Did not like the food very much.
4,"We came here after the launch party so the place was still lingering with decorations which was nice. The entrance featured a garland of fruit of which the pineapple caught my eye. The setup is on the rooftop so it's nice and breezy. I usually opt for an Andhra meal and this was my first encounter with a Tam-Bram style thali. While it was different and not as spicy, it was really good. The dish that stood out was the pumpkin kheer which was very well made. The sabzi of the day was a mix veg which had a simple and homely taste to it.All in all I enjoyed the food and would like to visit again."
3.5,The payasam was good. All the other items are average. Nothing special. Ambience gets two thumbs up. Staff is also courteous. Good to have an authentic South Indian an authentic South Indian meal restaurant in Bsk 2nd stage
4,VALUE for MONEY..!! A must visit for south indian food lovers !! Served in leaf :) Quality food and I totally loved the taste :) Will surely visit again.
4,Food was very tasty.Indeed a treat for all South Indian food lovers.Service is also very good and fast.Overall one of the best family restaurants.
4.5,It's a very nice place for authentic south indian food!!! The ambience is very good too.. The meal is served in plantain leaf and is unlimited..The food overall was very tasty and unique and the best part of the meal was khara kholumbu!! Overall kidambi's kitchen is a must go place for authentic south indian lovers!!
4.5,I had been to this place on a saturday afternoon with my wife.Kidambi's kitchen has a very nice ambience and the food is very tasty and different and is a complete value for money...the staff are very courteous overall a very nice place for authentic south indian food!!
3.5,Kidambi's kitchen is exclusively for proper South Indian meals(tamilian style to be specific). Sambar was very good among all the food items. Ambience is pleasant. Overall the experience was really nice. Definitely worth a visit.
4.5,"A traditional South Indian place serving South Indian food on a plantain leaf was something that was missing in Banashankari and this place nails it. It's located in the same building as Hara and this restaurant is on the rooftop. The service is very prompt and the people are really friendly too. The place is nice and airy with a lot of plants and has a nice ambience. The meal is unlimited and consists of a kosambari, a palya, a type of  dal, papad, a type of dessert, buttermilk, curds, a variety of rice, some chapatis, rice, rasam, sambar and some khara kolombu(a tamil nadu speciality). Overall, it was a lovely dining experience :)"
4,"This new entrant in BSK 2nd Stage, a foodie catchment area, is a welcome addition to the area's bustling grub scene. I called them for one ""home meal"" and it was a delight. The food is home-like, authentic South Indian (without the now mandatory paneer or butter or masala). I called the restaurant at 11.30 am and they brought the food home by 1pm. There was a lot of variety: palya, saaru, sambar, gojju, payasa, lemon rice, chapatis, pickles and papad. I found the pepper saaru outstanding and the payasa was lovely. The single ""home meal"", I was told, would be enough for two but we found it did well for three people with lots (especially the rice) left over for another meal. For Rs.300, it is value for money and fits the bill if you are looking for South Indian home food from a restaurant."
3,"Ambience might not be the greatest suite but the dosas are. But, next time try filtering cockroaches outta your upma coz it's disgusting to find one in middle of a hogging."
4,It?s a main road facing self service with limited place hotel near 1947- 100 feet ring road.Food is amazing!Open dosa and coffee to finish off.
2,Quality & taste got degraded day by day. This is not earlier famous Mane Thindi anymore. Not worth to visit this. Better to go across. 0.5 km ahead is the best Thaaza Thindi.
3.5,"Combo is the best item to have in this place , good taste and coffee tastes good ambience is not that good but for a quick bite it is ok to have here"
3,"Average place for having quick south Indian bites .It is located on the main road near Kamakya theatre and can be easily located.The service is fast and you won't have to wait long for the food. There are no seating arrangements except a few tables to stand and eat.The taste is average,many places serve better at the same rate.The chief concern is the hygiene of the place which is very poor .The staff should try to improve the situation."
3.5,An affordable place to have quick South Indian bites.They offer a number of dosa varieties and snacks.The place is always jam packed and they do not have seating options.The service is really fast and you won't have to wait much even when it is crowded.Personal favourites are the Benne Masala dosa and Avarakalu dosa.Highly recommended if you are on the look for tasty bites at affordable rates.
3,"Located on the main road when you're travelling from D.G Petrol bunk towards Kamakya theatre it's easily identifiable with a huge board stating it's name. It's a small eating joint with no seating area available.The food is average compared to the prices. They do have delivery system available and the packaging is neat. My concern cropped up with a couple of my colleagues fell ill after eating from Mane Thindi.So,hygiene could be one of the concerns. However, I didn't face anything as such personally till now.If you're looking for a quick breakfast or snack you can give it a try."
4,"Had the ""jumbo thindi"" combo !!Contains Idly, small dosa, vada etc.All tasted good. Crowd was more though.If you are near Kamakya or BSK, it's must visit ;)"
2.5,Cost is more Food qty not worth
3,"Average. Had an avarekalu dosa, somewhat of a seasonal specialty, but was strictly so so. Either the dosa bater or the masala had too much salt. Overall not bad, but nothing great.abyventura.wordpress.com"
4,"Brilliant place for a quick breakfast. If you're the filling food freak, there's a good option called the jumbo tindi which is really good for what it costs. Also Bread, Averakalu dosa are must tries"
3,"The place serves the typical South Indian food. Along with idli and vada, tried the bread and avarekalu dosa. It was good and worth the money. However crowded most of the time."
3.5,A good place to have a quick breakfast. The place is crowded sometimes and there is no seating arrangement. I tried marsala dosa and idli - vada and I liked both.
2.5,"Pathetic service,. I ordered for an Open Dosa and they didnt give me ""Sagu"" the Veg Kurma. I requested the person, he was very arrogant and told me in kannada ""sagu kodalla"" means i will not give Sagu..Pathetic service, all waiters have huge attitude problem.. not at all clean."
3.5,"It's just like every other small, self-service joints. Usually too crowded. The food is pretty decent, but not exceptional. The prices are quite low, which is a bonus. The place is quite hygienic too!I'll just give it a general rating. It's too common, to warrant section-wise ratings."
3.5,"Do not get fooled by the board ......its just regular darshini .....they serve usual idli ,dosa,karabath etc.....but thing I love the most is the breakfast combo ...You get also almost all the breakfast items on it and price is also less.....the taste of the food is pretty good .....items like dosa they haven't mastered it yet .....the dosa is either roasted too much or less or perfect ....it keeps varying .....but given the fact its one of the few darshini in banashakari area its definitely a thumbs up from side......prices are nominal .....Ambience is good ( self service only) no seating place ......the place is extremely clean and the service quite fast although its crowded during weekend morning rush hour ..........do visit this restaurant if your in the area.....or passing through devegowda petrol bunk."
4,"Awesome place for a breakfast or a snack. I usually go there every 2 or 3 days. Superb Ghee dosa, but vada should be had only if hot else doesn't taste so good. Overall good taste.... especially nearby that area..."
1,"Small darshini located on beside the dusty ring road. Looks crowded but it's not. As it is a small joint 4 people standing looks like crowded. I had breakfast in morning around 10.45 idly was not hot, vada is hard, sambar, Chutney is too mild. Conjusted kitchen for staff. hygiene is very low. Not recommended. Coffee is ok."
4,"There is no link to the name of restaurant mane thindi to food served it's a darshini which serve regular dosa, idli, chow chow bath etc with 1 spl dish of the day.Taste of food is better than regular darshini. The place is on Main road after kamakya. Parking car is a issue."
3.5,"If you're a Bangalorian, then you would love the ""Darshini"" culture here, which I haven't really seen in any other cities.Mane thindi, is one such typical Bangalorian Darshini and a good one too.For a Darshini the ambience is not bad, staff are friendly service is super fast.Now the food I ordered was something different, a ""bread dosa"". Yeiks, worst decision ever! They put fried bread pieces on the dosa and together it was so oily that I really couldn't finish it. We also tried ""avare Kalu"" dosa which was relatively ok.On the other hand my dad had a normal Masala dosa, and that actually tasted really good. So, if you ever go there don't fall for the name and order something new, rather just stick to the usual :P"
4,"This is a perfect breakfast place, right on the outer ring road, half way between devegowda petrol bunk and kamakya theatre.This place specialises in dosas and their ""jumbo thindi""They have exotic dosas like averebele dose, bread dose among others, which taste excellent.The jumbo thindi: this is a winner with a cute little masala dosa, a bowl of khara an kesari bhath, a single idly, vada and a small bowl of pongal. This is worth the money one pays for breakfast.The service is poor as the waiters are busy chit chatting among themselves...Must have: bread dosa, jumbo thindiMust visit for a quick breakfast!"
4,"The only restaurant that I prefer for breakfast on all the days near BSK III Stage. Had Idlys, Dosas and tried all their items in the menu which gives me a real good start for the day. A must place to visit!"
4,Located on the main road next to cake of the day..This is a fab place to have fast food at cheap prices.Masala dosas and goli bajji are a must try here...Their speciality is the avarekayi dosa that is available almost all the days a year...
3,"One of the First person to visit this place as it is located close to my House. Was Excited to see that there was a Hotel coming up in this area in Bsk 3rd stage Near Kamakya theatre. But after tasting it, i was Really dissapointed. Though its close, I Dnt feel like visiting it again.. It is a fast food South Indian hotel.. Which serves Idly, Vada, Dosa & other things.I felt The Chutney here is Not good. I think they need to improvise on it. Sambar is also Average like any other hotel. I wonder how there is so much of crowd in this place.. I guess its bcoz there is no other Hotel near by for a quick Breakfast. Ambience is good.Overall 3 stars.. A lot of Improvisation required."
5,"One of the best hotels I liked so far, I visit almost every every week and and Great taste. Liked all their food and Maintains good cleanliness and hygiene."
3,"We come here if not often, occasionally to reload on some fat fuel...Thupadu Dose and Avarekalu Dose channagi itthu illi. My husband's typical eat out...But after eating recently here a lot of my family members fell sick so thumbs down.."
4,A good place for a delicious South Indian dish experience.. The taste is good and the service is also good.. Overall a simple and best restaurant!!
4.5,I love this place for their tastiest khana!!!!!!During the avarekayi season...they make avarekayi dose....its totally worth what u pay!!!!!!amazing extraordinary taste...with butter melting on the dosa...!!!slurp!!The chutneys are toooo goood!!!!
4.5,Tasty breakfast. Yummiest chutney. Jumbo thindi is a must try. Kesaribhat and karabhat tastes just like mommy's made them. Avarekal dose is my fav here :)
4,Awesome breakfast at affordable price.The must order jumbo thindi.The sambar was not upto the mark but rest was just awesme.luved the kesari.
4,They serve mouth watering breakfast dishes all the breakfast items are gud the combo mark is cheap n best here..
3.5,Very much affordable for breakfast n south indian fast food.....Recommended item- jumbo thindi..
5,"Best mini foood place,wrthy,tidy place nice variety of dosas,soft idily,tasty kesaribath,crispy vada with complimentary tea n coffee,with worth price visit often classy taste everyone should try."
3.5,Their Jumbo thindi is famous. but no standard. Sometimes the dosa will be too oily
4,Nice darshini near devegowda petrol bunk. all items are moderately tasty although some of their daily special items are so so... rates are moderate....
4,Very fast service and delicious food.I've been there almost every weekend and never disappointed.
1,Arrogant service. Nothing special about this. Standard fare. Why visit?
3.5,Food tastes good! Here... :-) but maintainence is poor:-( workers vl b cleaning o doing something while v r eating oly:-(
1,Bad cold Masala dosa. Arrogant and rude manager and staff.
3.5,"Easily locatable.. on the main Katriguppe road.. Mane Thindi is easily one of the best south Indian food outlet in the area.. Don't hesitate to visit this place since this is a fast food restaurant..Very cleanly maintained... the dosas,idlis are good.. They have this ""jumbo thindi"" which is a combination of the idlis,kharabath,kesaribaths ..Coffees,teas..excellentIf you are in the mood for a quick stroll and some tasty south indian food..a must visit"
4.5,Amazing and the best dosas And the service is really fast...
4,Not many darshinis in blore maintain the quality that this darshini does. Variety of dosas. Coffee and tea are the best. Parking is a mess. You should park on the other side of the ring road.
3.5,"Nice place fast service and variety tindis, a olage for working professionals to grab a bite and go :-)"
3.5,"A welcome change in ring road area. I like the food served here. Famous for its all encompassing jumbo breakfast combo, i like the ideaSambhar are bit spicy for my liking but are compensated with fresh goli bhajisi go with 3.5 for Mane Tindi's breakfast spread"
4.5,this is a superb place to eat and it is cheap also
3,"A popular eatery in and around this area. Located bang on the ring road many people stop by for breakfast or atleast a cup of coffee. When it started the quality of food was indeed really good, now there has definitely been a dip.U get the usual south indian breakfast items like idly vada sambar, a variety of dosas, Bidi bele bath, khara and Kesaribath etc. Whats unique here is they have a combo or a mini breakfast meal which is called 'jumbo thindi' where u get to taste a little bit of everything. It as a single idly, a vada accompanied with chutney and sambar ofcourse, a small portion of khara and Kesari bath and a mini masala dosa. It is filling and all worth 40 bucks. The coffee is good too. The rava idly and shavige bath is worth a try too. Advisable to get ur food packed as its too crowded and less options for parking."
3.5,"Good food ! Crowded. Tea works like a stress buster ! Only problem is parking. You end up parking in front of 'Cake of the Day' ! Say ""Less Oil/ghee"" if you really want less oil. Or the ghee/oil is all over the dosa. Visits once in a while !"
3,Mini breakfast is good.Coffee and tea is good here.
4,"worth a visit.. especially the open dosa is too good..and if you're diet conscious ,this place is not for you... and if not, you can enjoy loads of ghee and butter on dosas and price is really affordable..if you're really hungry,try JUMBO THINDI, you'll get every dish in the menu on your plate.."
3,"For a quick bite of standard Bangalorean/South Indian fare, this is an ideal place to go. Get in, order, collect, eat whilst standing, get out! Simple isn't it!Reasonably neat and tidy, good quality of food, easy on the pocket pricing....what more can you ask for from this type of a restaurant. Peak hours do get a bit crowded and you have to jostle for standing space. Crowd does merge with the next door bakery and the ever present pani-puri wallah contributes to adding to the variety that you can get at this particular street corner.I found the ""Open Bene Dosa"" particularly interesting. Did also like the fact that they have a glass warmer (for tea/coffee).Would I go there.... Yes, Again and Again! Whenever I am hungry! Whenever I want to grab a quick bite! Whenever I don't to pay too much for a decent meal!"
1,Food & Service is worstPeople are not at all friendly.Avoid taking this food to teach lessons for this kind of people
1,Half baked rice in a special meal. Half baked roti only panneer curry was good. Serve the order with good quality or stop serving food in late nights or mid night
1,Not the standard quality
5,good
1,Cold food

2,I was order for dry but received gravy
1,he asked me to come down
2,we ordered something and they delivered something else .. and food is ok ok ..
1,worst food ever
1,Shittiest food ever eaten in my life. That promise something and gv something else. I had ordered a thali which wasnt complete s it was missing one order. Will never order from zomato or foodiction.Worst ever experience.
4,I love the masala puri n sev puri here. Better than most of the places. Will have to adjust with the ambience since u have to stand on the footpath and eat. They have few chairs laid out. But totally worth trying.
4.5,"Whenever I have craving for chats, first outlet that comes to my mind is Sree Venkateswara chats. Taste is very unique. A treat for all spicy chat lovers. Aloo puri is a must try."
4.5,"Indian chat craving started this weekend and I opted this time to visit this eatery. Taste was splendid and unique. Loved their Quality and Taste. However, had to adjust with Ambience. You love to visit this place again and again if you have their crispy Masala Puri. Cheers!"
3,"This is a small eatery located near Seetha circle. They have got limited menu of chaats. The quality of food is good, but I felt they can still improve it.The pricing here is just like any other chaat shop nearby. I've tried Masala puri and dahi puri here. Masala puri is nice, but I felt the masala was a bit over spiced. Dahi puri was nice too.=====================================Updated review June 18th 2016Been there with a few friends, and got to taste a lot of things! Service is fast and the food tastes yum!We ordered a Bhel Puri, Masala puri, Alu puri and Sev puri. This time, the masala puri was better than the previous time. Sev puri was good, but wasn't up to the mark. Alu puri was good, hot and perfectly spiced. But, I didn't like the Bhel puri at all. It was too wet and it almost felt like masala puri with a lot of puffed rice (kadle puri/ puri).Food 3/5"
3,"I usually go here if I feel like having road side chats like masala puri or Pani puri..This shop is maintained by mother and a son.. Service is really quick and price is very affordable..Must Visit place for Masala Puri, Pani Puri and Dahi Puri.Taste is really good compare to other chat shops in this location. This is well known for most of the people in the locality..I recommend this placeOverall:Quality: 3/5Taste: 3/5VFM: 3.5/5bangaloreepicure.com"
4,"To be frank, I never knew they were on Zomato :PI and Ashwin Kashyap visit here very frequently.It's located in front of Avalahalli BDA park front gate. They serve you street food in a not-so-streetish way. The place is very small. Trust me, it's just amazing how they've managed to find such a small shop. They've maintained good hygiene here.I've tried almost everything here. I love the tikki puri and Bhel puri here. The other items are good.It would be great if they have some chairs.Food 4/5Overall 4/5"
3.5,"People in Bangalore are more fond of Bhel Puri and Tikki Puri. This trend started from a School & College Days. Every corner in the streets will have Red Color finished Bhel Puri Carts. Its difficult to judge about Hygiene. Well, Vinay Bhel Corner is a tiny outlet and something similar to these Street Carts with respect to taste and hygienic when it comes to preparation area. Tastes extremely good if you are looking for Chaats like Bhel Puri, Tikki Puri and Nippat Masala. Prices are reasonable and highly recommendable place! Its a stone throw away from BDA Park bus stop.bangaloreepicure.com"
4.5,The most amazing chat-wallah near my home. Tomato slice is the best here. Have been going to this guy since the past ten years.taste is quite different.Options r plenty in number for chat lovers.Both quantity and quality are high. Located in an ideal place(in front of park).
3,"Bengaluru. . Has a different style of making chats. Should visit this stall at least once. Although a small place, but an awesome place to hangout with friends on a beautiful evening. Wish to have more of hot n masala puri n bhel puri ( bhel). Can't wait for the second round!!"
2,"My friends had been suggesting this place for a long time and I finally visited this shop, to try their much raved about Masala Puri.Taste wise it was alright, not really exceptional by any means (I've had better tasting Masala Puri in Bangalore). Their version had too much sweet, and didn't taste very good.My friend tried the Dahi Puri and I went for the Alu Puri, and they both looked and tasted the same. I don't understand the point of adding masala to Dahi Puri and curd to Alu Puri. Taste wise also, it was completely messed up as they had added too much sweet chutney to it.I also ended up with a stomach upset, not sure if eating at this place was the cause, but since I hadn't eaten anywhere else that day, and considering the hygiene at this place, it could very well be."
3.5,"A really nice restaurant with a lot of time spent in designing it. Haven't visited the bar part but the non-AC part is amazing. You have a tall ceiling height which makes you feel like you're dining at a very big place. But over the years , the quality has definitely come down.Also remember , they are going to delay your food by a considerably large extent.Overall A good place , would definitely visit again!"
4,"Great place for shawarma. Very good portion size for th price. Chicken is well cooked, tasty and creamy. Served with fries. Shawarma plate is my personal favourite. Would definitely recommend!"
1,Hai guys!! I didnot get a option to give 0 rate so just clicked one. I ordered the food threw zomato but got delivered from swiggy. Chicken kabab was worstold chicken stored one. it was black
1,"Very bad packing, it was very difficult to even open the food packet. Food was served cold and I don't recommend this place to food lovers. Please take this feedback and change the way you serve food."
1,"Worst experience Getting online order.I ordered Chicken Biryani and they delivered me FRIED RICE.I tried calling , after 30min one person accepted my call and said ""I delivered what order i get and asked me to call the delivery person.Even Zomato custmer service aren't replying me."
1,Gave 1 rating so that i could mention how cheap the restaurant service is.consecutively 3 days we ordered not none of the days it was delivered no confirmation nothing pathetic service
5,I had been for the lunch it was great experience had chicken biryani with guntur chicken it was awesome combination it was purely village style biryani ....
2,"Nice place for having a quick lunch. The place offers only self service which is a big draw back for me and also they do not accept cards. However they do take Paytm. Coming to the food part, this has been my go to place for lunch as its the closest to my office. Till ago a week the Biriyani was priced at ?60 which has now been increased to ?69. The Biriyani in itself is tasty but the major drawback is the small quantity that they serve. This is not just for the Biriyani but for all the dishes. I have had the chicken kebab, which is quite good but hardly having 5 pieces in it if you are lucky and charging ?70 for that is a bit too much. Then the chicken guntoor, spicy dish serves as a nice side for the Biriyani or kushka but still the quantity is pathetic. Overall the food is quite nice but the quantity is laughable."
3.5,"Ate classic fries Nd it was tasty. The ambiance is good even though there is not enuf seating spaceThey have maintained the place very neatly & they accept all kind of payments.(paytm,phonepe,MobikwicK etc)."
3.5,I vist here almost every day as it's close to my office! As mentioned above the service has to be improved a lot. and the taste never remain constant. too too slow people. If the coffee is light when asked they make it strong thats not and issue.
1,"I was tempted to go in, with the assumption that this might be the next hotspot for hot idly and shtrong filter kaapi. I was sadly mistaken. I could barely complete the plate of idly I took and the coffee tasted very light.Not at all good! Avoid!!!"
4.5,"Had a conversation with the cashier who was more than happy to spill the beans on the coffee bytes story. I mentioned that it had garnered poor reviews online and he told that the head cook was changed recently.In complete contrast to the opinions given so far, the idli was good today. We were a group of 5 and all of us would definitely recommend the masala dosa. The sagu needs some work. Chutney is good. A good place to spend time with friends."
3,"Coffee Bytes is the newly opened quick breakfast joint in Hanumanthanagar. I happened to visit here within 15 days after they opened. It?s a self-service joint with limited breakfast menu which includes Idly Vada, Kharabath, Kesari bath and Coffee.In recent times, there are so many joints opened like Coffee Bytes and food is brilliant. But here everything has to be improved. Idly was totally taut where the Vada was lack of crispiness. Kharabath was bland too!Folks at Counter are bit arrogant and service is slow. Place is nicely maintained with decent dÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå©cor! Food is decently priced and one of the value for money joints for the south Indian breakfast.Overall:Taste: 2.5/5Quality: 3/5Ambiance: 3.5/5VFM: 3.75/5Service: 2.5/5bangaloreepicure.com"
2,"The taste is nice when you eat the roll; and that's about it. The appearance is not that great, and neither is the after affect of the rolls. But once you start having it on a regular basis, it's alright."
1,Ten people every month fall ill to severe food poisoning and qcute diarrhea. The place has been requested by many people to the police for a shut down.
4,"Don't let the appearance fool you before trying, they are very very good. Comparing to other roll shops near this shop, Yo rolls stands out for the simple food and the price that can be for the Budget conscious. On a Hot noon day you can see many young studenta hanging about and ordering alot of Rolls for lunch. This shows the popularity of this small place. The food is very spicey for the sensitve but good for those spice lovers out there. Please try it on when you visit there."
3,A staple for a lot of hostelites when they're low on cash.The rolls are really cheap & Filling.Do not go here if you're a hygiene freak as this place has none.Generally a bit crowded & Your order can take 5 to 15 mins.
4.5,Best place to have rollsEspecially chickenIts just deliciousNow wordsIts very close by to my place soI always prefer this place so its a walkable distance nd a very good place in quality nd even taste
1,"Seriously, fire the cook or have the biryani tasted before it goes out to your customers, pathetic biryani or if you could call it a biryani, even lemon rice with chicken pieces would have been good, just improvise, you guys would do great for the location you are in."
2.5,When it opened I visited this the taste was good... But later cook changed the taste worsened which u can't eat at any cost.. It was tasteless..kebab was totally burnt.. Bad experience..
5,"This place serves the best chicken hakka noodles I have ever tried. The noodles are thin with loads of veggies, chicken and egg.Economic, tasty delivering fresh and hot food on your door step."
3,Quite good placeVery pocket friendlyTasted grill pizza bit weirdBaby corn finger fries was goodCheese shots was bit okAnd coming to last its a cozy place to have quick tasty bites?
5,The kushka and chicken fry is one of the must try dishes at this place and I absolutely love love this place. I would eat from here everyday if I could.The tandoori chicken here is a must try.Please do visit this place for pocket friendly and happy tummy meals.
4.5,"Yummy and best grilled chicken I have tasted and homely food, don't forget to taste their Donne biryani ,pocket friendly prices makes this place a go to place every time, their staff are very friendly."
5,"It is a small joint where you get one of the best grill chicken in Bangalore and budget friendly,staff are very friendly and you can also try their Donne biryani."
3.5,Raams is a small eatery near the Vidyapeeta Circle. The place is famous for its grilled chicken and it's really upto the mark. The other dishes ain't that good here. But the donne biriyani tastes nice. So head out if you are low on cash and want some cheap non veg food.
3,A small outlet on Kathriguppe main road. One of the fewer places to go for when u r low on cash :P They do serve good biriyani and grill chicken. The prices are very reasonable. The taste is good. What else does one need when u can get a good biriyani under rs.100 :D
3,Rams chicken place where u have good grill chicken.. Noting other than grill chicken u get in rams.. Once tried lolypop but it wasn't good n chilly chicken as well they weren't good in taste.. Only go fa good grill chicken...
3,I love the grill chicken they serve here. The Kerala porota they serve is not technically the authentic one. In fact not even close . The gravy what they serve along with it is pretty much pointless. The other fry items are nothing great. They have many customers often ordering grill chicken though.If you live by this area then sure drop in once and order their grill chicken.
1,"Earlier food was average, but from past year the quality has gone down in drains, recently took chicken biriyani parcel and found cockroach in it, only item which is better is grilled chicken"
3,"Its a fast food joint located on the busy main road of Srinivasanagar. The establishment set up here has no seating area so you need to stand on footpath and eat. Food served ranges from short snacks to main course. Overall, the quality is good. I ordered a paneer butter masala (rs. 95) and tandoori rotis. The quality and quantity was nice.If you are ok with standing in footpath and eating food, then you can give it a try.Quality: 4/5Quantity: 5/5Ambience:1/5Worth for money:2.5/5"
3,Was once a very good place . But due to all the pollution and the surroundings you don't feel like eating here . Though you have to literally stand on the foot path and eat with all people walking around . The food is average there are better places to try nearby than this.
3,"This a very old, popular chat center established more than 20 years, has a legacy in BSK 1st stage. one of the oldest chat centers in the locality. Budget friendly, Taste is not the best though. they serve juice, north indian and Chinese along with Chats. Masalapuri is a must try here."
1,"This chat shop belongs to cakes and slices. When this was started the Kerala paratha and few chat items used to be yum. The last time I tried chats here was around 3-4years back and it was terrible. And that's it, I have decided not to eat chats here again. Mango milk shake is the oh thing which is nice."
3,Biryani rice is normal bullet rice.price is less.givwn one egg also in biryani.food is ok type.Delivery: on timeFood quality: averagePacking: good
4,"Had heard about this place from a few friends and decided to visit this place. I had the avrekal dosa and a coffee. Both were very good. I asked for gatti chutney but they did not have it, also the price seems to be a bit too high. The food and service was good, I'd be happy if the prices were a bit lesser."
5,Amazing dosas you get here. I suggest one should try all types of dosas here. Small place but very tasty dosas. They have opened up one more outlet on Chikkalsandra road near Padmanagar. Dosas are good in both the outlets. But coffee is amazing at Chikkalsandra outlet.
4,"This places serves some best dosa with variety of options. Corn dosa, butter masala dosa, open butter dosa, chili cheese dosa, palak methi dosa. Etc. Also you get to have all south India breakfast, evening they serve momos. Overall a good place to have breakfast and best dosa.Cheers"
1,Worst place to have sea food ?I preffer not to have foods here cuz id ordered for prawns fry and the chef prepared and gave me prawns chilly and the cashier also was rude !!!!
2,Chicken pieces in biriyani is not of good quality...During my personel visit chicken biryani is nice...But now it is not good..I hope they will maintain nice quality for online orders also...

5,amazing.
5,nice and tasty food.
1,Been there few times..all parcel...it was ok in earlier visits. However this time when I ordered anjal fry quality of fish was very poor. A disappointing visit.
2,foo was decent
3.5,Never been to this place but ordered several times from here.. Biryani is average.. Though its not a Chinese place I still liked the mixed fried rice here.. And the chicken leg roast as well.. The quality of the food has come down since the place first opened up and only selected items are worth trying here..
2,Very bland biriyani. Pls dont ever try kabab here. They once gave me rotten pepper chicken. Only foods worth trying here is andhra style chilli chicken n chicken Manchurian n butter chicken too. Very arrogant cashier tho.
2,Horrible..tried ordering twice..kabab was lil rotten and stinky from inside and rotis burnt on first order..second time grilled was nt even cooked properly..biriyani is only thing which is avg good.. definitely wudn recommend any1.
4,"Don't order biryani, though the name of the place suggests so. Try Pepper chicken, kori rotti and curry, neer dosa, chicken sukka, chicken leg roast, kalmi kabab. Amonst sea food - pompfret masala fry, anjal rawa fry and silver fish are great. Prawns aren't great though."
4.5,"This is second time am visiting this place. I really like the taste of food here, pure Mangalore style taste. Ambiance is OK, not so attractive but service is good. Chicken Leg roast, fish double roast was superb... One should really try neer dosa also here."
1,"Not good.. all the times i ordered,got kacha meat. Chicken is not cooked well and its raw. Salt too high. Feels like its not fresh and freezed meat served all the time."
4,"The place is good, I liked it :) :DTry the pulpy grape juice that's one of the best grape juice I have tasted . . .I had to type 140 chars :("
2.5,I went here as my Room is near.. And the food was okey.. The Rice was not Basmati in Biryani.Price is More compared to the Quality of the food.And there is no place to sit and eat here.
1.5,Biriyani not up to the mark. Ordered Mutton Biriyani. No taste. Have not tasted the chicken Biriyani. So cant comment.Though the side chicken dishes were nice. Not giving a visit again.
3,"ambience was above average.. too much salt in all chicken items.. neer dosa was not al gud.. Only gud thing was chicken roast and the bill, which was below par.. not worth visiting..!!"
3,"The quantity is really good. Well,the taste, wouldn't say excellent but not bad too. Had ordered half biryani and half kebab, and wast disappointed. Do visit this place"
5,"i visited here for the first time. Food is nice... good for fast food lovers, i liked grill chicken... Biriyani is also good, clean & neat place to dine in"
5,"Dont expect high class hydrabadi biriyani, its a local style Biriyani good compared to near by restaurants. Neer dosa and tandoor items are tasty."
1,Very bad attitude. Having a crowd in restaurant makes them arrogant. Not ready to serve meals in service hall. When asked them they said it is their policy. One person in the restaurant said he is the owner and he cannot do anything for that.Fish tikka was very nice. Please do not order biriyani. It is nothing but watery yellowish rice with meat pieces.Fish meals is worth for money.They spoiling name of Kunadapua by adding its name in their menu :(
1.5,"On the eve of Diwali, we tried bunts biriyani restaurant.... Awesome weather due to cyclone, wanted to try fish in mangalorean style.. We ordered Bangada fish fry (Rawa), fish kabab (pics added).Bangada was deep fried was crispy... Never expected that crispy (like chips) and kabab was pathetic was cooked without salt n chilly.. This ruined our evening dinner and didn't feel like to order anything.... That was the end of disgusting dinner.My ratings :Ambience : 3.5/5Food : 2/5Service : 3/5"
4,"If you go by the name or for the biryani, you will highly be disappointed since the biryani isn't made of Basumati rice and isn't that good. But rotis, starters, gravys and authentic Mangalorean dishes are too good and worth the price."
2,Paradise name doesn't suits to this restaurant. Biriyani is not up to the mark. As it was not I never took a chance to eat anything more as main course itself tasteless.
3.5,I don't understand why they have named it like this as their biryani is tasteless and pretty much the same which you will get in any normal biryani hotels which have opened these days like mushrooms. But my rating is for their sea food. I'm a big fan of karavali cuisine and always stand front of a row for such hotels and so I checked this hotel based on curiosity then later after few visits understood their true skills. Their fish kebab and crab fry are must try. Kundapura chicken with neer dosa is another awesome combo. Place is easy to locate and strictly for meat eaters only. My frequent visiting place when I crave for sea food and can't travel for far place on search of good food.
1.5,Pathetic Biriyani. I was more boiled rice n chicken together with some turmeric. My rating is for Gobi Manchurian else it cud hav been in minus for Biriyani if the rating system.allowed to.
2.5,Not so good. Masalas were very bad.Maybe i have a north indian taste.but still the chicken was old or rather stale. Too much rice with less chicken..and overpriced also.
2.5,"Biriyani is average , chicken tandoori was really bad.!! Good quality , nice place to hangout and chat with some chicken . Reasonable price. Good service."
3,"Average biryani, nothing great about it, what is worth a try is their grill chicken, not much competition around, if you are in that locality and wouldn't fancy to drive around, this place would do good."
4,"After moving to Bangalore recently, Bunts was the first place I tried Biriyani from. I absolutely loved the chicken biriyani.. it is different.. milder than usual but I kinda liked it a lot. We tried couple of other dishes from there such as the Manchurian and Naan.. it was good but nothing special. Then we had the grilled chicken leg once.. that was yummilicious! I would return for the biriyani and grilled chicken for sure. ;)"
1,"I visited this place recently, experience is very bad, first of all they don't know how to cook biriyani. They use very poor quality rice in biriyani the taste is too bad. We asked for starter chicken 65 that was again pathetic. I will never recommend this place to anyone."
5,Nice one in surrounding areas. Leg roast is one of my favorite. Golden dry is also must taste. Biriyani is good compared to the other restaurants nearby. Try in once.
3.5,Speciality is seafood tat too neerdosa n mangalore chicken curry or fish curry. Rest all are just menu fillers. I had mutton biryani too. It was gud. Serve chilled soft drinks in summer atleast!!!
2.5,"Chilli chicken seems like the best bet here ..biryani doesnt measure up despite being proudly suffixed on the name. Others in the cast include some Mangalorean specials, almost always tweaked with new age quasi Chinese sauces that render the flavours quite overwhelming. Mostly a takeaway unless u don't mind wolfing Biryani and kabab standing darshini style by a busy road. Cheap and student friendly."
3,Best place for chicken leg roast in whole bangalore.Even neer dosa is good.Biryani is not good.Ambience is not good.Service is average.Bill won't burn a hole in your pocket.
4.5,"Guys, this hotel is the best for leg roast! you Will really love it forever! even chicken biryani is hot and spicy. i came here thrice just to eat leg roast. its the best."
3,"Felt the food was pretty expensive and not up to the mark. Poor Ambience ...more like the darshinis in Blore , difference being that this one serves non vegetarian."
4.5,Guys try Leg Roast.. Its Awesome...
5,Very close to house....good fish food.
3.5,At 110 rupees this neighbourhood style biryani tastes better than most around. Better than Biryani corner which is nearby to this place. The rating is totally because of its really tasty biryani. The place is clean. Don't expect something amazing as I already mentioned its neighbourhood style biryani. There is a service hall also upstairs which I haven't tried yet.
2,I had been once to this restaurant... Cos my house is very close to this restaurant... Food quality is not up to the mark... Biriani is tasteless... Curd rice was only the dish where we can eat peacefully... 1st floor service is too bad... Non friendly staff... I have decided not to visit this restaurant again in life time... They need to improve a lot...bangaloreepicure.com
1,Below par food
4.5,Biryani s really yum..Spicy nd authentic....Giv a try nd its worthThey serve neer dose nd mangalore style chicken curry..whic s mouthwatering
1,Kind of order I have received. Uncooked and looked as if dough was days old which was used to make chapatis. It was kind pf rotten smell coming from these
1,I have ordered boneless curry. And I ended up at a with bone curry and ended up throwing it away. I have sent photos as proof to zomato chat support as required it. So much for waiting for an hour only to discover food which I hadn?t ordered
1,got the order from.some other hotel and the quatity is too less
5,best
1,"ordered paratha and pickle combo, didn't get picked and curd was spoiled .,there is not even a single piece of paneer in paneer Patiala ( chef might have forgot to add paneer in gravy).,very bad experience , never ever order food from this' Funjabi curries ' . day started with very bad food"
1,Food is not good... Noodles were smelling like its was prepared 2 days before...bad smelling.. I throwed it.. Food is not good please give fresh food
1,No salt
4,GoodGood
2,wrong order was placed
2,taste want to improve
1,poor quality no taste i ll go with swiggy they will supply quality and hot food
5,"nice , koot is good"
1,paneer not good
1,"Rude staff. The attitude is terrible. Moreover the owner enterains such crude behaviour. Can't expect high standards from a small restaurant. But, this is extremely pathetic."
4,I ve been visiting this hotel since 8years it is best for breakfast and dinner the taste of vada and onion dasa will be very good and it is best place to have ur breakfast
4,I actually checked into Udupi Upahar in Nagawara area right after Manyata Tech park on left hand side if coming from hebbal.I am not sure this one here and Nagawara branch is related.The food quality is top notch. It is very fresh.Most importantly i noticed that the kitchen is kept very clean.If you are passing by this area or live nearby i would highly recommend that you try breakfast or lunch here. You will thoroughly enjoy the restaurant for its freshness and cleaniness inspite of being right by the road.It is right next to overbridge right after Manyata tech park on left side.
5,At first form childhood onwards I won't like idli. I don't like the taste of idli. When I came to Bangalore then my sister forced to eat idli vada. That is the first time I loved that idli. Up to now I was eating idli there only
2.5,"Best outlet for fast and ready food. You can find service hall upstairs. You will get Breakfast, lunch and dinner but as far as I know service hall opens at noon. Its just opposite to bank colony bus stop."
3,"I'm the last person to judge south indian food. However, they seemed to be doing great business which was an indicator that they do what they do best. We tried their masala dosa and though there's little to innovate on that front, it was good and fulfilling."
4,This is perfect place for breakfast and lunch...uthapam and idly are very good...Gobi Manchuria will be the best you can here....cheers...:)
4,"This darshini is located behind Bank Colony Bus stop towards Magestic. Dishes are good. However, I prefer chaats over other dishes here. Bit crowdy at times but serves my purpose when I need have quick breakfast or a chaat."
3,"It's just a OKAY kind of hotel. I'm visiting this hotel occasionally from past 4 years, nothing has been changed. Neither the interior nor the taste. It has a small self service wing and a medium sized service wing. Kitchen is not so big and hygiene has not maintained well. I ordered paper masal dosa and vada... Both were just above average. It can be an alternative if you are out of options.beingbakasura.com"
3.5,This restaurant is located in Bank Colony circle and the best quick breakfast and lunch place... The dishes are very nice compare to other darshani's in this locality...Just like other restaurants they have service and self service too..Price is affordable and Value for money..Decent service area..This restaurant is filled with bachelors and students all the time...Authentic dal and Gobi Chilly is really good and must tryOverall:Quality: 3.5/5Taste: 4/5Ambiance: 3/5VFM: 3.5/5bangaloreepicure.com
3.5,"Consists of a fast food and a service section.. this restaurant is a popular one among the Srinagar residents ..easy to locate.. on the main eighty feet roadI love the North Indian meals here..  the pricing is reasonable..consists of rotis , two subzis  and dalPulao, curd rice,salad ,soup,papad and a sweetWe had ordered extra sides i.e. Paneer butter masala which had the paneer,butter and the masala giving us the individual flavors in literal senses  :) If you are in for a good deal for your pockets and also a good taste at the same time.. Srinagar Udupi Upahar should be your choice"
5,Good place for quick eat. Dosas and idli are favourites
2.5,Okay okay!
4,Cheap n best. Not a luxury hotel but the food is good and affordable and worth. Pure veg hotel which serves both south n north Indian dishes. Parking 4wheeler is a concern as its situated in bank colony junction.
4,"Pakka naati style military hotel. Had been to this place with my brother, tried Boti fry, kal soup, biryani all tasted very good. Service can be better."
2,"Visited this place with my friend on a regular Friday 2.30 PM which is a good time to lunch. But which I gone thru was not at all expected. No biryani for 20mins but when I got biryani it was very average, kababs was decent, mutton fry was cold & 3starer, chicken leg was good but pretty cold. Place is not at all clean and staffs are not at all ready to hear you. Over all pretty disappointed."
4,"Visited on my way back from work at about 8pm.. there were not many people present at this time... it must be usually crowded during the daytime ... ordered the traditional thalemamsa Fry, Keema ball and paratha... Awesome taste .. will be back to try out their other dishes.."
2,"The food was very good. Authentic Karnataka cuisine.But the service was one of the worst I've seen, not accomodating of their customers need."
3,Not worth the hype.. quantity and quality has gone down and expensive for the quantity served. Needs to live up to the rating and legacy. Lot to improve
4,"If u want try Authentic gowdru style home cooked dishes this is the best place to visit. My personal favorite is fish fry and mutton fry. The dishes are bit spicy but delicious . Ceylon parrot and mutton fry is the best combo. Biriyani taste resembles Donne biriyani style. Keema ball's are filled with flavours and gravy is delicious.My must try dishes are fish fry,mutton fry,ceylon parrot and Keema ball and ragi ball's."
5,A traditional military hotel!Very clean and big and the service is also very goodThey also have a separate family sectionWe ordered the mutton biryani and the chicken kababs!Both of which are a must tryWe also ordered the chilli chicken which is very spicy and flavourful
5,"I tried mutton biryani and mutton leg soup both tasted good and spicy and the ambiance was also good, it is too busy at morning, service was acceptable"
5,Nice and delicious dishes what else one can expect. Pakka Military hotel desi style. Many options in chicken and mutton. Biryani is mind blowing.. Best place to visit with friends band family too.Location: 5/5Ambiance: 4/5Service: 4/5Food :5/5Overall: 4.5/5Must visit.
5,"What could be better than eating biryani for breakfast?Visited Ranganna hotel on a Sunday easy to locate.Never seen a military hotel so big and so clean.They also have separate family space.Ordered Idly, Chicken biryani, chilli chicken and plain soup.You will love the idly and curry or dosa and curry combination here, the biryani is very well spiced it's hot but it wouldn't make you feel heavy after eating it tastes more like chicken pulav, the chilli chicken is another outstanding dish very well flavoured, the soup tastes like rasam with some meaty taste would make it amazing if it was served hot but on the whole it was definitely worth it.Aditi NarayanAmbience 4/5Food 4.5/5Service 4/5Value for money 4/5Overall 4/5"
3,"A strong turmeric flavour in every dish you get here. May be it?s the ?naati? style or May be it?s the ?ranganna? style. Not for all people, it?s an acquired taste- either you love it or you hate it. Personally it didn?t please my palate."
4,"Nice place for a non-veg craving early in the mrg. Not many places serve non veg early mrg. Had a chicken Biryani it was kinnda chicken chicken pulav more than biryani. Taste was good typically pulav types but it was good. The plain soup is a worth for 15 bucks . Biryani was lil costly bcoz for 160 + taxes I can get a better biryani all day long .Good place nevertheless for a non-veg lover , next time gotta try the dosa and chicken .Tatse 4/5Ambiance 3.5/5 (fairly crowded early in the mrg)Service 4/5 (prompt)Value for money 3/5"
4,"Very old and unique military hotel, feel like homely food. Especially mutton items are very taste. Biryani also unique taste. Usually in the lunch time little bit crowded."
4,One of favourite military hotel in bengaluru for amazing naati style breakfast. Ofcourse they are available for lunch and dinner also but I love having food here for breakfast.It is usually crowded for breakfast here. The service is a little quick only.First thing to have here is the leg soup.Plain dose with mutton kheema masala be a perfect breakfast here.The biryani has a very good subtle flavour in it. Definitely a must try.Ambience - 4/5Service - 4/5Taste - 4.5/5
4,"The best paya and dosa in South Bangalore without a doubt!Get there early morning and binge on some dosas,idlys,paya and soup. I?ve been eating here for years and this place maintains the same consistency. ."
4,"It?s an ideal Legendary Military Hotel. It?s stunning how they maintain their flavors and the taste for so many decades ! A small and simple menu to choose from this is definitely a Goto ! My top picks include the Biryani, chilli chicken, kebab and parrota! !!!!"
5,"Good and decent quality food, non-veg lovers can go and try the stuffs out there.Ambience and Service: 4/5, the higher rating is not because of the lavish decoration rather for cleanliness and cordial staff!!"
4,This is the main streets of Basavangudi Gandhi Bazaar.Always crowded and fast service. Nice food.Priced properly. Service is quick.North south chinese available too. Like their gravies and chaats.Been for south Indian breakfast too. A good place.
4,Taste is good and ambience is fine. But I observed a bit late service from the staff as well as the seats/tables are very much near to each other. I feel congested somewhat.
3,Roti Ghar is good for vegetarians small and sweet to have a good lunch or dinner with family and friends service interior nice food taste of delivery is good
3,Ordered a paneer tikka manchurian and crispy veg. Quality of food not up to mark. Paneer wasn?t fresh. No proper taste in the crispy veg. They even added batter fried beans into the crispy veg. Was weird.
4,"Colleagues and friends planned lunch here which was a 30 minutes drive and the whole affair was an 1.5 hours getaway from intense meetings. Loved the food here and the price is just unbelievable. Having stayed in NCR it's pretty hard to see a proper Kannadiga cuisine layout. The Puran poli served first was a meal in itself. The ghee roast Mysore masala dosa was multiple notches higher in standard than the ones I have tried so far. Puliyaogare and curd rice were one of the best I have tried so far. They also served a come of our choice of ice cream as dessert. All for 150 bucks, an 8 course meal !!!! Going to come back for more for sure..."
4,Awesome old place in Basavanagudi and love their dosa and mallige idli..coffee is really good..ambiance and service and hospitality needs to be improved..
3,Food was okay okay but this place will be always busy with people and at ground floor it self service and at 1st floor you can find seating was quite cleanService was okFood taste - 3/5
4,I recently been here which is after 10 years!!When I was in btech college I used to come a lot here! But in today?s busy life and Bangalore traffic it?s difficult to travel in Blore ?One of the best place for North Indian food. They give taste quality and quantity for reasonable price! Which is very rare!I had ordered buttermilk which was for 30 bucks! I felt it?s expensive but when I got my order I was shocked to see buttermilk was worth more than 30 bucks for it?s quality quantity and taste!!One must try roti paneer combo and manchurians !!
4,"Good soup, nice starters.. panner chilly, pepper fried corn are good.. All the items tastes awesome.. good variety of curries in main course.. table booking is recommended on weekends.."
3,Taste - 3/5Staff - FriendlyAmbiance - Very BusyReally nice and pocket friendly option. The food tastes just as good as it is on the pocket. The rice and chats are nice and so are the dosas.It tends to be crowded most of the time due to it's popularity to the masses. Dining also is an option other than self service and that too is really nice
5,Visited here after years and still the taste is the same and their quality of food too is amazing! Always a must visit when in Basavanagudi! I always take their roti curry combo which is worth and will fill your stomach!
5,"This is the best place to have food , we get all varieties of food like North Indian , South Indian ,chats ,juice , ice cream this is located in gandi bazar this place is crowded all the time it as self service as well as dinning area .Must have food was fried rice and ice creams"
3,"The food was served fast and it was yum: Paneer Manchurian, Veg Kofta, Veg Sweet Corn, Butter Kulcha. ?The ambiance howerver was horried so dim that you could not read the menu ? and felt like a local bar ?. They really need to use a different colour.And the staff need to be told to stop staring when you are eating as it's very irrtating.Overall the place has good food, @Management has to consider the lighting and staff. And because of this the 3 rating."
5,After MTR we always needed another hotel with the typical karnataka cuisine. Every item is delicious. We end up tummy full of contentment and satisfaction. Though it breaks the diet but worth the cheat diet.Don't miss small hot dosas
3,"If it weren't for the 'interloper' north indian sounding roti and dal-subzi in the midst of a tasty plantain meal, I would have given it a 4*. The menu is almost similar to what is offered at the Lalbagh MTR, but at a good 100 bucks less. Crispy little masala dosas and the always good coconut chutney, which has in a way, come for me to define one of the best things about the city, the dates holige, cucumber and sweet corn kosambri and pomegranate sprinkled curd rice, these r a few things I liked in the meal. Pulav was unnecessary, and the garlicky malodor stunk in my nostrils. Puliyogare was alright. I skipped the sambar rasam part. And we lost the ice cream coupon, so we gave it a miss(anyway my friend claims the ice cream they had served him was absolutely bad! ). Oh yes the servers had worn these malnad style caps made out of what? Arecanut shell? Maybe:-)"
3,"For all the veg lovers ! A pure Brahmin style cuisine ! My mother got me here since i didnt know abt this place....They serve Soup , Kai holige, cucumber salad, corn salad, pinaple curry, masala dosa, Pulka, Pullav, lemon rice, White rice, Sambar & rasam, Fries, curd rice, Ice cream etc Its just a one time visit. Il rate 3.5 !"
4,One of the oldest restaurant in Basavanagudi which serves amazing dosa and idli sambar...people do hangout here after their everyday routine walk in Lalbagh or Krishna Rao park to have coffee and lipsmacking idli sambar..
4,"Nice place near Basavanagudi, worth trying all the items , Dosa and vada is too good , any item is good it is always filled with people , coffee is goodAmbience:3.5/5Food:4/5"
5,"Located in Basvangudi and is a perfect place for a simple yet tasty breakfast.Best filter coffee and idly,vada!Their sambar is just delicious!I wouldn't recommenced the masala dosa....The bisi bele bath here is really good!The price was very reasonable. Highly recommended for a good sunday breakfast."
4,"SLV is probably the only place that serves a chutney dip. I went there with my cousins on a Sunday morning. It was packed to the brim with people which was a really good sign. We were soon seated and we ordered poori, masala dosa, idly chutney dip, idly sambhar dip, vada and vada with sambhar dip.The ambience is pretty basic like a darshini style. It?s properly ventilated and quite a few people can be seated at a time. The service is quick and courteous.The poori was fluffy and not oily. It tasted really good with the saagu and chutney. The masala dosa was pretty standard. If you like very crisp dosas, you?ll like this. The idly chutney dip was delectable. The chutney was refreshing with the flavour of coriander and coconut.What I didn?t quite fancy was the coffee and tea. Both of them were very strong and even my cousins felt so.Overall, a nice breakfast joint to go with your family.Food- 3.5/5Service- 4/5Value for money- 4.5/5"
2,"While I've tried this place in the past, wanted to try it again. Went here this morning n had rava idly. First things first. The prices on the menu is slightly on the higher side for a darshini type of hotel. Idly costs 28/-, rava idly cost me 32/-. This is no brahmins coffee hotel in chamrajpet. Nevertheless coming to the food, it certainly isn't the best. Chutney was salty n sagu was bearable. Rava idly is just about average n nothing much to rave about. Would you regret if you miss this place? Most likely A BIG NO. If I can come this far, another half a kilometer ahead, I would rather go to brahmins coffee hotel. Though the price is high, they compensate with good food. Nevertheless another ""no more visit to this hotel"" in my book."
4,"Food : 4/5 || Ambience : 3/5 || Value for money : 4/5|| Service : 4/5Located at the heart of Basavanagudi, has one of the best Masala Dose.Vada + Sambhar (dip) is one of my personal favourite.The sambhar is full flavoured and crispy vada tastes delicious.Everything from Rava Idly to Coffee is satisfactory.Recommendations : High"
4,"Food- 4/5Service - 4/5Ambience- 3/5Masala dosa, vada sambhar, idly, and other breakfast items are really good here. Loved the chutney as it had perfect consistency and spice.Will visit again for sure."
4,"This is a no-frills place in NR colony that serves yummy South Indian lunch at affordable prices. Hygienic, healthy and total VFM.Must have: Sweet Pongal, Rice-Majjigehuli, Puliyogare and Masala MajjigeThe place is open only for lunch (between 11:30 am and 3 pm or until the food lasts) and is a hit among the professors/teaching staff from the nearby APS college and people who would want to take away food (note that you will have to carry your own boxes to take away food from here)My rating of this place:Taste: 5/5Ambience: 3/5Hygiene: 5/5VFM: 5/5Speed of Service: 5/5Overall: 4.6/5 (excellent)"
2,"Heard a lot about this restaurant and the food. With expectation had been to this place on last Saturday at around 2:00 PM. Place was Crowded , decent and especially more for take-way. We have to collect tokens and go further inside to collect food. Yes its a self-service and few chairs are available to seat. We ordered Puliogare, chapatti with bhindi curry and sakkarai pongal.Puligare was some what balanced in spices and ok in taste. But bhindi curry and chapatti are very disappointing, too much of sweetness into curry and totally not good. Even we felt high sweet in sakkarai pongal. Even the people who serve food have lot of attitude issues while serving food.Food price is nominal and pocket friendly.Overall: 2/5Ambiance: 2.5/5- No dedicated seating arrangements, Few round stools are available for seating.Food: 2/5Service: 2/5Price: 3.5/5Enjoy your food and make sure food is not wasted.sandeepkasal.wordpress.com"
5,"I tried puliyogare and ambode. And I like the puliyogare but ambode was a little cold, one of the best authentic Iyengar hotels in Basavanagudi, price is very cheap but the quality is good"
4,"This place is unique for there authentic Brahmin food and taste! Service at this place is quick, staff is friendly and handle customers really well! Menu is pocket friendly looks simple. It is really hygienic, tasty and healthy ? must visit place around NR colony(near to Mahila mandali school)One suggestion would be - opening the restaurant around 9 clock would be good and ideal!"
4,"Just simple and Tasty !! Please do visit this place, if you love to have homemade,Bramhin/Iyengari style taste and food.I feel they planned the place very well, in front of there own house,correct me if i am wrong!! It is very close to NR Colony BusStop. I didnot have food in this place, but a take away, First things first,Loved ther paintings. Prices start from 5rs to 30rs, Yes you read it correctly. Visit the place to witness the same.I took, Puliogare and Ambvode, it was packed well. I stay 10 minutes away from this place, once i reached home and unpacked the food, it was still fresh. Coming to the taste, Puliogare was spicy,tangy and good to taste. Ambvode was not hard, but good to taste, it was fried in oil, but it was not too oily. I would love to taste there Sweet pongal and khara pongal.PS: You can carry your boxes from home to pack foodsridhar1206.blogspot.com"
5,This place is as authentic as it can be. It?s also very hygienic. The staff are friendly and welcoming.Must try EVERYTHING ON THE MENU. ( trust me it?s worth it)The dishes are very reasonably priced with no compromise on the serving portions.Thanks to the restaurant to keep the authenticity and tradition of local cuisine alive.
3,"Okay-ish ...they have good variety on the menu, also comes at affordable prices. This outlet is small yet peaceful because of its location. Homely food.No filter coffee available."
4,"Is a small place but has very attractive paintings on wall the food tastes very good , it feel like homemade food must try out food was PuliyogareV get only few number of foods in the menu but with very good taste it as varieties of food like ambode sakare Pongal , Kara Pongal and nowadays they have introduced chapathis also , Maintains was very good and in polite way"
4,One of the best restaurants situated right beside the very famous Satellite bus stand!! Filled with authentic foods at cheapest rates!! Their butter chicken and paneer butter masala is definitely worth a try!! Filled with mouth watering kababs and also you can try their biriyani too once in a a while!! We ordered paneer butter masala nun kulcha and cold drinks and was really satisfied with the taste!! Guys do try this restaurant its really worth ur penny!!
1,"Worst experience , staff not good and even taste not satisfied. We can go other places , in road side only the taste I'll be good . Please don't go"
3,Okie Satisfied and good Dishesmust try chicken lollipop is good ..Service is good but they should also try home delivery...Family and friends Restuarant Awesome place but parking space should be Broad ..
4.5,Value for money restaurant located opp to satellite bus standAll items are reasonably pricedTried the lemon soda its awesome ?Biriyani is okKabab was quite goodRotis and gravy were good ?One thing to specify check ur change when the waiter returns ur money ?
5,Very GooD value for Moneytasty well maintained a try a must place in MysoreRoad opp Satelite bus stop I had beem there 3times i found d same awesome tasty my favrite over there is Tandoori chiken and all food items are very Tasty GooD ...

4,Good pace..nice n peaceful environment.. Food quality n quantity I good..a place to visit..service here is quick n staff is also good..nice environment
3.5,"Had to wait for a bus for a long time, so decided to have lunch from Bridgeway.I had to wait sometime before someone came to take the order. No complaints as I had plenty of time. Once the order was made, it was a matter of time for being served, hot!! I ordered Ch.Manchurain Boneless and Kerala Porotta. The food was exquisite! The boneless chicken was full of bones, and I took a good 5 minutes convincing the waiter that I ordered boneless and i got with bones, even the bill said boneless, not quite sure what his stance was :p.Apart from that fuss, overall a great lunch with great value for money. Ambiance also cant be complained about as they provide some decent seating. Would definitely visit the next time I am bound to catch a bus from Satellite Bus StandCheers,Arvind Sojuchugnchow.wordpress.com"
3,Ok food........... Quick service..... But customer service needs to improve a lot...... Reasonable price...
3.5,"I had never planned to be here. My family and I were on a bus ride from the un-happening end of Bangalore and had to change bus at Satellite, an interchange station. For the uninformed, Bridgeway is right opposite Satellite Bus Stand. We were famished and did not have the patience to wait for lunch after another one hour ride. We crossed the road and quickly ordered for chicken starters, chicken gravy, Biryani and few rotis. All I can say is, Bridgeway isn?t fancy but serves delightful food at nominal charges.Visit 2: Brought my friends here on a mid-month cash crisis and ordered Chicken Biryani, Chicken Noodles and Tandoori Chicken. Not a bit of disappointment. My friends were happy that I suggested the place (Thank God!)Must try: Tandoori Chickeninstagram.com"
3,"Wow, the thing over here I found was really good is there ambience and the food..... And d thing i experienced d worst was there service.... If u order something u will end up in getting something else.. I wish they should give employees over there good training on d food available at there... But yes, itz pocket friendly and if u have a zone of tolerance... Thn u can go with it.... :)"
5,It's a good and tasty ???? restaurant on Mysore Road from sirsi circle to Ramnagar. Once you visit. Definitely u love ? it. It's have 3 choice sitting space like with family or friends or alone
4,"The restaurant doesn't look too good from outside, but has space to accommodate every kind of people. Chicken served here is too good, hell lot in quantity, and it's unbelievably cheap. Fried rice is above average. Chicken curries are good. Tandoori items are good too. And sorry vegetarians. No review from my side about veg dishes as I haven't tasted them. For chicken lovers, this is a place for you to have good quality chicken at very affordable prices!"
3,"Its not like u can say its a worst kind of restaurant....located just opp to satellite bus stand..non-veg items are really good...  I personally like tandoori and chicken lollipop...starters are really good...I am not sure about veg items here as I didn't try ..but my friends suggested its not a good place for veggies...ambience is not so good...average...price is really unbelievable..its really cheap... I can't beleive for 13 people, it only costed 3700 including deserts..."
1,"Worst service, roadside food tastes better than the food served here. I'm extremely unhappy with the quality of service"
2.5,Decent place to eat before you travel from satellite bus stand .. Within budget and decent chicken items
4.5,It's a nice place right opposite to satellite bus stand... Food is tasty n within budget.
3.5,"Located in front of satellite bus stand, it's a Good Food junction. I suggest you people to order Chicken items it's very tasty n go for Kerala parota n in Rice go for Jeera rice."
4,"It is a kind of worthy place, as we get 1+1 for drinks and hookah ,i had ordered nachos, hookah, lollipop, fries ,eggrice, veg fried rice and many more items. It was quite good. Thankyou"
4,This restaurant which the food will be good! Then it has more music experience.Food 4/5Service 4/5Ambience 4/5So where we can get all drinks and hookha at one place.
3,"I would give this place a thumbs up for its outdoors facility; sitting arrangement and open screening. Ambiance is average, no loud eardrum-piercing music (probably due to Fifa screening). You can actually hear what the person before you is speaking. I did not like the way this place was lit. Extremely dim. Forget taking pictures, you won't even see what food you are ingesting. And to top it, there was no tower drought beer available. That too on a saturday night. Too bad! That ain't great a move to up your slaes Soho Bar.We were a group of 15 people and had to do with pints of kingfisher. Food was above average, but nothing to go gaga about. We had ordered both vegan and chicken dishes and they were good to eat. No complaints, but I have had better. Hookah was ordered for the end credits. For me, pegs of VAT69 plus hookah meant a decent combo. Overall, it is a chillout place for friends and acquaintances. ??"
4,"Taste - 3/5Ambiance - 4/5Service - 4/5Wonderful place for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They have a variety of cuisines from South Indian to North to also Indian Chinese.Its good food at a fairly moderate price point. It' had a clean and well lit ambiance in the service and self service parts of the restaurant. Perfect for family eatings too.The staff are prompt and quite helpful."
4,"Since it's Located on the busy bull temple road, they do not have any parking space. They have nothing self service and dine in. They have standing tables and seating in selfish service. Service is very quick and it's always crowded.Pulav - a very tasty breakfast item here, the quantity served is good.Roti Curry - they serve two rotis, one gravy, dal, a small cup of curd rice and onions/lemon. The gravy and dal were amazing.Pani puri - would not recommend this. Chats section could look at an overall change.Overall it's a very economical place and not heavy on the pocket. Also this is best when you have to eat on the go.Food : 4/5Service : 4/5"
4,"This is a newly opened place in basavanagudi which is diagonally opposite to dodda ganapathi temple in bull temple road. Went here for breakfast n ordered masala dosa n kharabath. Requested dosa to be less oily n masala to be given seperately. My wish was their command n was given just like how I wanted it. The dosa tasted good n no complaints what so ever. Kharabath was good as well. For the pricing stand point, standard darshinis charge more than this hotel. Besides u get to sit in the self service area as well. It's neat n hygiene standards are maintained. Finished it with a coffee. No complaints on my visit so far.. Good going. Can surely visit without battling your eyelids."
2,A joint in Basavangudi. Self service as well seating there. Dint like South Indian dishes. So never gave thought for other dishes. They have to improve very much in the quality as well taste. We took Idly not at all soft and was sour. May be batter was very old. Disliked dosa too.
4,"Very good restaurant, we had south indian snacks. Masala puri was very good. Dosas were light and crispy. Service speed is ok. Ambience is good. Hope you maintain it well. But what I noticed was ill distribution of pricing, especially for chats section. Way too costly for chats. We appreciate, if you correct."
2,"Well.... after my breakfast here, i had stomach upset!!!!!!! food taste needs to improvement.....sambar tasted a sour and even the masala dosa was not good!! my friends along with me also were of the same opinion!!!"
4,"Had lunch here Masala Dosa & Coffee.The place is small and has place to sit as well as stand.There was rush so had to stand and eat.The restaurant is slightly different from the bunch of South indian restaurant that you normally see , they have tried to make the ambiance better.Till now atleast the restaurant is maintained well and clean.There is a service hall in the first floor but I didn't go there.Overall food taste was good!"
2,"Had been here for breakfast, idly and vada was good, but sambar tasted a little sour and not pleasing.Masala dosa was not good at all, it was not soft and tasted weird.Coffee was pretty good.Service is also good, but food taste needs to be improved."
4,"This restaurant was suggested by my mom, it has all cuisines like North Indian , Chinese and South Indian. the service is in the first floor and the ambience and service is really good. The masala papad started our lunch with palak soup and hot and sour soup, all the three had a very good taste. Then we had paneer ghee roast which had very good flavours of curry leaves and coriander and tasted really good , the paneer tikka was our second starter was also good . The tawa mix gravy had a different taste ,the gravy was very smooth with lots of veggies, the Gobi masala was not great ,it was okayish. The fried rice also tasted well and coffee ended our lunch very apt...."
4,"A relatively new restaurant in the vicinity though have few two wheeler parking place there is no dedicated parking however leaving that aside the food tasted good be it South Indian or North Indian , the ambience was good topped with a better service. We had ordered a full course meal with soups , roti , kulcha and starters a special mention was for paneer tikka and paneer ghee roast even the tawa fry as curry tasted good, if you are in the place definitely give this place a try. The point on which they can improve is AC could be bit more and space is bit small apart from these a good place."
4,"We we're referred to this place by my father in law who regularly visits this place for its good coffee. Going by his words we dropped in for lunch on one of the weekdays as we expected it was not crowded. The decor is simple and bright, similar to that of Sukh sagar-Shanti Sagar types. We saw only a 2 or 3 staff members but they were quite helpful and prompt.We order tomato soup, Baby Corn Manchurian, masala papad and Paneer ghee roast for starters. The quantity is generous and the taste surprisingly exceptional. Then we had corn and capsicum masala, dal tadka, rotis and Kulcha. The corn capsicum masala was well prepared not too spicy not to oily a big thumbs up. The dal tadka was bland and the seasoning was burnt which made it inedible. The breads were soft and we'll made.The prices are extremely affordable. We we're 7 of us and the bill came up to Rs1700. Close by to where I live and good food, hence would like to come back here."
3,Ok this place is not so well maintainedHookah is the main attraction hereFood is OkThe Service is goodThis is pocket friendly hookah place
4,Redberrys will provideswonderful ice cream flavours and some tasty delights to fill up your tummy with the italian touch friendly staff's quick response towards the customer food in redberrys were good and tasty we loved the pizzas that they serve nice place to hangout with friends one of the best place to jump in
4,"It?s a place for having Gelato, not Ice creams!!! They have quite good variety of fresh gelatos. They are known for gelatos, although they have started serving Burgers, Pizza, Pasta now, Pastries & cakes. But I prefer this place for gelato, they are made fresh, very tasty and prices are nominal. The location of the cafe is on the busy DVG Road, some of the gelato flavor?s which I liked are Bramhins coffee, Belgian Chocolate, Oreo Blast, French Vanilla and Bubble gum. The pricing of their geltos are priced very economically and offer value for money. I didn?t try other offerings, so I won?t be able to comment on the same :-). They also take orders for cakes and pastries. The place is neatly maintained, hygienic has seating arrangements for 15-20 people. Decent ambience,  One can visit this place and enjoy their Italian Gelatos"
5,1) pizza. shake and salad very nice2) location of red Barry's very nice3) staff good4) over all redberrys very nice places.. cool & simple places to enjoy evening with group of friends nice
5,"I stopped by this place when I saw the board on it's door saying they have a buy one get one free offer. When I went in, the place seemed ok, not a big cafe, just a small shop with some seating arrangement and air-conditioning.Food: I ordered a paneer and bell pepper pizza, Joe's burger, a Alfredo penne pasta and a farmhouse pizza. EVERY SINGLE DISH WAS AMAZING. They were fully fresh, extremely authentic taste and super budget friendly!! I also ordered a chocolate cake with Snickers ice cream. That was brilliant too.I'm Definitely come here again. If you guys are on a tight budget and want to eat amazing food, do come here!"
4,Very good dosa place.Love their Kali dosa masala Dosa. Always crowded. Very affordable.Quick service.Very tasty. Love their carrot halwa too. Its a very old hotel.
3,"An age old hotel of Basavanagudi. Before moving to the place they are in, about 8yra back or So, they used to be on the Bull Temple Road.Their famous khali dosa is still the same. Fluffy, oil less and tasty. Their aloo palya is kind of ok-ok, along with this khali dosas. But their trade mark watery chutney is still great. Refills of this watery chutney keeps happening as their staff keep a moving around the hotel checking their guests for a refill.Ended up with a delicious cup of coffee. No match to this.Worth the visit."
4,"A legendary place in Basavanagudi, this place doles out some good breakfast options. I tried the famous benne dose and kesaribath. Both were about above average. Many old timers feel the place has lost its old charm. Nevertheless it is worth a visit to savor some delicious breakfast"
4,"Old school joint, still lives upto the charm. One of the best Khali Dose?s. Do try their masala dose too. The palya (Potato Filling) was very flavourful. Tip: Ask for benne for the khali Dose. They charge extra."
4,"This is one of the legendary place in South Bangalore. Located opp Hanumanth nagar bus stop. Known for it's spongy Khali dosa , pineapple kesari bath and Masala dose. It's all mouth watering and much more better than it's competitors like Vidyarti Bhavan etc in cost wise, quantity wise and tase as well. If you are foodie you should visit here once."
4,One among the iconic places in Basavanagudi. The kpb which is khaali Palya benne is the best dish according to my knowledge which is priced at 46rs for 2 dosas. Heavily crowded and demand gets more n more as the evening passes. Visit here to relish a delicious taste of dosa.
5,"A pride of Basavangudi. This restaurant has been operational from many years even before I started eating dosas.This is the #1 restaurant for soft and tasty Khali Dosa. The Rava Vada and Pineapple Kesari Bath are other items I like.The watery chutney is best when you eat it poured on top of the Dosa rather than on the sides.If you love dosas, this is a place to visit !!"
3,"This place is serving food from past many years in Basavanagudi, DVG Road As the name says Nisarga Garden, If you need a outdoor seating feel of having your food, you can visit this place. I have been going to this place from past many years, Menu is simple , you get South Indian Meals, Parota Curry,Dosa's, Juices and Ice Cream. When i visited the place recently on a Sunday afternoon it was crowded, seating / seats needs to be changed, some small makeover must be made to attract more crowd. Taste wise , it is decent, You can visit this place to have a decent meal and a budget friendly optionsridhar1206.blogspot.com"
3,"I was pleasantly surprised to find a hard core nonveg restaurants in the heart of basavanagudi...I ordered egg Biryaani, crisp fried chicken and everything ....... The egg Biryaani was the nati style and pretty good.................Biryaani was flavorful and delicious.............................................................Crispy fried chicken was nice but some of the pieces were undercooked and not Crispy................Overall a nice place and well definitely try here for more dishes..............................................................."
4,"Just when you feel like eating some mudde n chicken curry . This is the place to go to . Love love their chicken biryani, chilli chicken n the mudde with chicken curry! Favvvvv"
4,Had been for mid Day Meal from many days. Finally we were able to make it. We thoroughly enjoyed the Full Unlimited Meals of the restaurant. By the time we came to 70% of the lunch we were feeling full but some how managed to taste every dish served to the last. Must try for people who want to try perfect Udupi Thali.

4,Another packed breakfast place in Gandhi Bazar with both ground floor and the first floor seating. I had to wait for around 20 minutes to get a seat on a Sunday morning. We started with idly which was average but the vada here was just fantastic with the right balance of crispyness and softness. The masala dosa was more on the softer side than a crispy one but the taste was really good. Obviously a coffee is a must after a great breakfast like this and yes the coffee was just perfect and hot. A highly recommended place for an amazing South Indian breakfast.
4,Nice place to enjoy Authentic south Indian meal...good staff .. pocket friendly alsoThey have other varieties also but one should must try meal at this place you vl get to eat everything in one plate ifself.
4,"One of the authentic South Indian breakfast places.They have delicious sambar and dosa.Went there unplanned and had idli,kesaribath and dosa and I easily skipped lunch after.It?s super affordable and delicious"
1,Mind blowing banana plaintain leaf meals. Unlimited @ Rs240 each. You will get juice & 1 sweet & holige & also banana & paan beeda in the end. Overall very good south Indian meals. Almost wedding feast like meals. But the ONE PROBLEM is you they will bring each item only once so you have to ASK them again and again  to serve if you need anything MORE. They should honestly bring ALL ITEMS at least twice.
4,"Mind blowing place. The special meal is something to crave for, go for, keep going for.Starts with vegetable sabzis, chutney, molaga bajji, rava idli, coconut poli, poori & sabzi, pulao. Then comes the white rice with Sambhar & Rasam. Curd rice, payasam & thayir vada. Did i mention all were unlimited. Cost? ?210."
2,"taste is average , less quantity they are giving 50% off, but it's Nt enough to have, please make sure Nt give offers like this restaurants !"

5,"Curry leaves is an multicuisine restaurant specializing in chinese, mangalorean, and Indian cuisine.The ambience is a huge space consisting of two floors . The first floor being the fine dine and the second being the bar.The place is mostly crowded on weekends.Some of the recommendations here are1) anjal masala fry: fresh fish and yummy masala.2) prawn ghee roast: super amazing, highly recommended!! However the vegetarian version made with mushrooms is equally awesome.3) prawn ghassi with kori roti: yummy and healthy option4) chicken malai tikka: done right5) crispy corn : classic bar bite paired well with my pint of beer.In desserts the gulab jamun was done nicely.The service is quick and prompt and the waiters are always eager to please."

4,"I visited this restaurant for a Sunday night dinner and it was occupied by mostly families in no time. It's an Andhra cuisine restaurant so would be an apt choice for people who love spicy food.In the starters, I loved the rich Prawn ghee roast.The mains consisted of Makai palak which was sweet corn and spinach curry, NILGIRI MURGH and a mildly flavoured Mangalorean dish, Prawn Gassi curry along with neer dosa.I also tried the crispy kora roti,which is made of rice and a speciality of Mangalore, with chicken curry.We ended the meal with gulab jamun and Gadbad in desserts.missfoodaficionado.wordpress.com"
4,"Its a nice place with convenient parking. Suited for a casual dinner with friends or family. The pricing is placed very correctly. For the kind of food quality and service they provide the pricing point of around 1200/- for 2 is absolutely fine.In the starters the mushroom ghee roast, khafila roast chicken and prawns ghee roast tops my list. They go very well with any cocktail. I specially liked the Pina Colada and Long Island Ice Tea. In the main course Deewani Handi, Nilgiri Murgh and Mutton Chop Masala are the must try!The meal ended with a very enjoyable brownie and Gadbad (ice cream sundae). I will recommend a visit to try the delicacies and the place has all the right things to easily become a regular hang-out place."
4,"I visited this restaurant for a Sunday night dinner and it was full in an hour.

The ghee roast was spicy but delicious.The mains consisted of Makai palak which was corn and spinach curry, NILGIRI MURGH and a mildly flavoured PRAWNS GASSI along with my dosa.I also tried something new, kora roti,which is made of rice and a speciality of Mangalore, with chicken curry. Crispy roti went well with the curry.In desserts I liked the gadbad which was an ice cream with fruits and the gulab jamun."
4,"Well, as far as I know Curry Leaves is one such restaurant which serves Andhra Thali at very nominal price. Believe me, it?s as good as other expensive places with respect to quality and consistency. I had been here a couple of days before for dinner and decided to try some Coastal Food. I started with Mushroom Chilli, it was very well done with strong flavours and it was made exactly like the way I want. Mushroom Ghee Roast wasn?t so authentic. However, I would certainly go back for it and the pricing is certainly competitive. Interiors are decent, I mean you can take your family without second thought. Neer Dose and Veg Curry was just okayish. Probably, one can skip this dish. Their GudBud is simply awesome. Folks are attentive and knowledgeable.bangaloreepicure.com"

Starters here are quite good, so are the main course dishes and desserts.The vegetarian options are equally good here.The Gudbud ice cream, famous in Mangalore, is made quite well here too.foodnwine.in"
1,The food was prepared in dirty oil. Firstly it was very oily.And there were Black color particles on the fries and sabudana vada.I think goli is getting bad day by day.Quality not maintained.
4,"In goli you get the best vada pav. Classic vada pav, cheese vada pav, aloo tikka vada pav are my favorites. These vada pavs are literally hot and spicey. The chill they give with the pav is lit. One cool place for hot and spicey snacks."
5,The 1 st time I ordered paneer vada pav. It was really amazing and very crispy. There was a lot if mayo in it and that was the best part. It was very big as well. Loved it 🤩?!!
5,Goli was right next to my house but now it's closed. So I always ordered a cheese vada pav and cheese unglis. They were just awesome. But the only issue is that I'm not too sure about the hygiene. Rest everything is good and plus the cashier was kind.
5,"While passing on the road we say Goli Vada pav shop we like to try some pav it's is yummy and mouthwatering we tasted maharaj Vada pav,makkai palak pava, keshar kulfi and khajor kulfi and Limca very nice moment and the person mr.prakahh order taker helpful and friendly"
3,??? A very small outlet located at Gandhibazaar... Vadapavs from Goli's are my favorites.... This outlet also serves some good varieties of vada pav...??? Ordered Maharaja Vadapav with cheese and Goli fries...????? The fries were very crispy and deep fried...? too oily... The quantity of cheese in Vadapav was very less... Barely little cheese was spread...I have tasted the Masala Vadapav too... it's amazingly hot and spicy...????? Anyways it's worth for the prices though some items are overcharged.... Takeaway would be preferred... Ambience needs to be improved when compared to other Goli's outlets.. There are lot of files in the outlet and not that clean with on overloaded dustbin... A 3.5 rating just for the food...
3.5,Very bad service by the staff they are too lazy and they don't make an effort to make vada Pav. Vada PAv tastes ordinary these days. Sodas are also not that great
4,"They are serve good Mumbai style Vada paw . Only I disappointed with they don't warm the paw . But they have a good option and varaity , any way when we got Mumbai Vada pav in Bangalore it's great for me I am loving it..."
3.5,goli vada pav was the brand whch every one liked initially . Later they did not maintain their standard as before . The only plus point of this one is they deliver home through zomato delivery and swiggy too . So this has around 66 outlets all over the bangalore . It will be some where near to every body so u can order it online as well . The best part of the vada pav here is the big size of pav and different types of vada which we get over here . But anyways this is not the original vada pav wat we get as a perfect maharastrian cuisine . But this may satisfy your crave for vada pav . Also they make sabudana vada which quite unique and different .
4.5,"Well this is the place i started eating vadapav.The vadapavs here are amazing and worth the money.They keep starting new things like spring rolls, pizzas i hv almost tried everything here .You should try the potato wedges,schezwan vada pav and the masala vada pav for the spice lovers nice place should visit if u dont want your pockets to get burnt.Taste -4/5Value for money -4.5/5Would i visit this place again -yesWould i recommend this place -yessonaliboliya.wordpress.com"
3.5,"I am not a fan of vada Pav, but I like Goli for their cheese ungli and other fried and unhealthy stuff :)This place has a lot of unique flavours among Vada pavs like Schezwan, etc.The sabudana wada was hyped , but didn't live up to my expectations..Will I go there again? Meh!! :/"
3,"Decent place, like any other outlet of goli. Classic vada pav, cheese ungli are nice. Service is a little slow. It was a regular hang out for us from Jain college."
2.5,I remember the days when goli has just started in Blore and I congratulate them on their success.My all time favourite here is the masala vada Pav....ooooff spicyBut yesterday I kinda got stale smell and taste from the buns??Sabudana vada is horrible..always ???
3.5,"This was the first Goli Vada Pav store I visited in Bangalore, and used to be a regular here until a few months ago.Their vada pavs are not at all similar to 'authentic' Mumbai vada pavs, but they're unique and have a distinct taste/flavour. If you like spicy food, I recommend their Schezwan or Masala vada pav. Otherwise, go for their Palak Makkai or mixed veg vada pav.Apart from their vada pavs, other items aren't really that good. But all items here are certainly pocket-friendly.Food - 3.5/5Ambiance - 3/5Service - 4/5Value for money - 4/5Hygiene - 3.5/5Overall - 3.5/5"
3,"Really good looking and we'll maintained snack junction. However, I didn't get the taste of this Maharashtrian cuisine which I had in Pine and Goa. Hope they bring the taste to Goli's Pav bhaji."
2.5,This place is part large joint chain of vada pav..Place offer consistent material but the cleanliness is last point and the people who are handling food handles all the materials by bare hand in front off you...you will be little skeptically in eating the same..Place for self service is big but not managed properly...only stars is for price and food quality...but it has to improve if this has to run for long time...
2.5,Service was indifferent as was the taste of the food. The regular vada pan was average. I was told that the ingradients are delivered every morning. I was there at abt 1100 .
3.5,"Hankering for quick tasty snack,like a vada Pav?Goli is where the craving ends.One can find goli outlets in almost every nook and corner of Bangalore nowadays.The menu is very simple.My most favourite is the classic Vada pav which has nothing more than a Pav and a tasty vada.Cheese ungli, Makkai palak vada Pav and sabudana vada are a few must tries...."
3,"Was quite surprised to see no crowd in this outlet on a weekday afternoon. This outlet is not different than any other Goli Vada Pav outlets in Bangalore. Just like other outlets these people are also least bothered about the customers. I ordered Masala Vada Pav, it was delivered very quickly. Taste was just average. They haven't spread the chutney evenly on Pav. The fried chilly kept on serving desk was below average and not salted properly.Later I ordered Chat Malsala lemonade which was very poor. Soda used in it was not strong and it felt like jal-jeera. You can give it a try, but don't have high expectations.beingbakasura.com"
3,"Have Been here very long back.Aloo tikki and Makkai Palak are best you can have. Test vise it is little far compare to mumbai vada pav test. But yes best vada pav test you can find in Bangalore.Cheese ungli was test less, so dont try and last you should go for kesar pista kulfi.There was no combo available at that time and it's self service kind of outlet."
1.5,Highly overated brand and the pav doesn't taste authentic like bombay. Just another way to loot in name if pav. Very costly and unsatisfactory.
4,"Bangalore is filled with the Goli centers.. I like the Gandhi bazar branch because it is quite calm.I have tasted almost all the items herePersonally,Classical vada pav, makai palak vada pav Cheese ungli are my favoritesThe schezwan and masala vada pav are little more on the very spicy sideI am yet to taste the Brownie here... I dont like the sabudana vada simply because the other places have better onesThis outlet is situated right beside Aathithya hotel in Gandhi bazar..Perfect for quick bites to temporarily take care of your cravings :)"
3.5,New one for Chamarajpet... As said earlier best india burgers... beware here at this branch as the owner has the habit of fooling you in bills...
3.5,"One of the fastest growing chain in the City... Well known for best Vada Pav, they have atleast 50+ or more than that outlets in Bangalore... I have tried almost everything in the Menu including the Kulfi's... 2 things are my all time favorite...1. Regular Vada Pav2. Sabudhana VadaBeen to this outlet several times when ever i pass Gandhi Bazzar...Best part is Service is really good and quick.Taste: 4/5Quality: 4/5VFM: 3.5/5bangaloreepicure.com"
2.5,"Its a small cozy place, very much not the taste of vada pav, its an blend tweaked pav for the present generation.. Good menu some of them are worth the pay..."
2,Its a small shop located in Gandhi bazar.The Vada Pav's feel more like burger than vada Pav's.There are lots of street side shops which serves Vada pav way better than this place and are economical too.The vadas are oily and the veg vada pav which barely has any vegetables other than potato.
2,Their shezwan vada pav is inedible..feels yukky and toxic...
4,"Had been to this place to have my breakfast, I choose palav over bisi belebath! You have South Indian,North Indian as well as chats and deserts! Chats at this place starts after 12.30 which is good as well! Located at Gandhi bazar circle, this place is quite familiar(Vidyarthi bhavan, Sln,Udupi bhavan,A2B, Gokul are few popular restaurants nearby)! Prices are average."
5,"This is again a IDLY-CHUTNEY joint in Bangalore, it was started 2to3 years back, it's very good hygienic food available here, VERY TASTY, the place as many options and it's really very good and reasonableMust try this place"
5,This place is an absolute worth a visit! All their dishes are amazing! They have a limited menu options but their taste makes it up! Their Vada and Chutney is so yum and also give their Shavige Bath a try! Will always stay on list of favorite breakfast places!??
4,"Best place to have breakfast in Basavanagudi, authentic Brahmin style food without the use of garlic and onions, idli and Vada are the best."
4,"N.R.Colony?s very own Brahmin Coffee Bar inspired eatery. This is right next to the bus stand so very easy to locate, and you most definitely cannot miss the crowd at this place.Ambience ? Even though it is a small place they have maintained it well, very hygienic. There is no place to sit but there are few tables on which you can keep your hot plates and eat.Service ? There is no proper queue at the counter so it is a task to place your order. However crowded it gets your food will not be delayed.Food ? Menu is similar to Brahmin Coffee Bar but there are you additions like Avalakki (Flattened Rice) and Navane(Millet) bath.I have tried their Idly Vade, Kharabath and Avalakki. Every dish is served with chutney, you don?t get Sambar here.All the dishes here are really good but Idly Vada is a must have!"
4,"Yet another old-school, old Bangalore type breakfast joint in Basavangudi. Obviously didn?t disappoint.Tried the usual:Khara Bhath, Idli Vada, Kesari & Coffee."
4,"4.5/5: This place may not have the legendary status yet, as it is relatively new, but is surely going to give the other hotels in Basavanagudi a run for their money. The crowd swarming around the food court makes you wanna dive right in and eat the food. I've been there twice, and am stumped by their crispy dosas and yummy chutney, and their filter coffee. Filter coffee is not a rarity in Bangalore but there are some places where it should not be missed. This is one of them. Another important thing is their importance to hygiene even in the extreme rush. I'm definitely looking forward to my next visit and try their infamous Kharabath and semiya upma."
5,This is among the best breakfast places around basavanagudi. The chutney is simply perfect in terms of spice and consistency and goes very well with idli and vada. Kesari bath is also very good. They keep the place hygienic and service is systematic and fast. Dishes have value for money and are very satisfying. Will keep visiting frequently.
5,"I just love this place. Their hot idli chutney and vada, avalakki is something to drool about and the thought can make me hungry at any point of day. Best part is their filter coffee after a scrumptious breakfast. That completes it all."
4,"It is not hard to find a South Indian hotel in Basavanagudi, as the area is literally a food heaven and swarms with South Indian tiffin centers in every corner! However, some places are better than even the supposedly best ones, not only because of the food they serve, but because of the typical Bangaloresque vibe they exude! Upahara Darshini is one of the very few food places that come into that category! Go there any time of the day and there a rush both inside and outside the hotel. But the service is super fast. I've been there twice and it's been a pleasureful eating on both occasions. I've had the Bonda Soup. The bonda was good and the soup is really delicious. I somehow knew it would be good, but the taste of the soup is better than I assumed and I didn't forget that for a long time. And the coffee and tea are good too!Given a chance, I'd prefer this than any other outlet in the vicinity."
4,"This is everyone's most favorite place, be it for a quick snack or for an elaborate dinner. The restaurant has a Darshini downstairs where they serve dishes of all cuisines, from South Indian shavige, idli vada, masala dosa to North Indian, Chinese noodles and Manchurian. They also have chats and special ice creams. They have budget friendly platters like tawa pulao and vada pav served with masala pav bhaji and jalebi, dhokla and agara petha. Best part is the 10 rupee cone ice cream!! This time I ordered a tawa pulao platter, veg Manchurian, masala dosa and pav bhaji. Needless to say, everything tasted great. Especially the pineapple icecream with had real fruit pieces."
4,"At the corner of DVG road near NR Colony Bus stop, this joint is always crowded. One of the best masala dosa I ever had. all the visits to this is quite satisfactory. As its quite old, its very congested due to crowd all the time. But It is because of taste. Food is awesome."
4,What the food seriously Amazing food mind blowing dosas and mind boggling filter coffee authentic and true Bangalore style ? must visit place
4,"Taste - 5/5Ambiance - BusyOne of the older restaurants in Bangalore that's had a name for ages. Theyve maintained to keep the same taste and the same customers, even more, to keep coming daily for their food.Ever had cravings for dosas, come here. They make one of the best masala dosas I've had till date. All the other dosas, idlis,etc are also really tasty."
5,"One of the legendary South Indian outlets in the vicinity. Crisp masale dose's, kadabu, and shyavge are to crave for. Absolutely delicious and can never get bored of the taste. Love the place and their food."
4,"One of the oldest eat outs of Bengaluru!! Nothing new to expect, menu is almost the same everytime you visit yet something you enjoy to eat!! Not so very crowded, service is pretty quick!!"
3,"Another gem in Basavangudi which had been present since pre-Independence times.We ordered khali dose, carrot halwa, and a cup of coffee.The dose itself was decent, but the chutney was a disappointment. As a pakka Bangalorean, I'm of the opinion that no South Indian dish can be called 'good' if the Chutney isn't good.The carrot halwa was very tasty. The coffee was good as well."
4,"One of the oldest hotels in Bangalore,as we know basavanagudi has so many legendary hotels and this is one of them. Though it's not so famous as Vidyarthi bhavan, this place truely is the gem. Tried masala dosa here and really liked it. It's one of the good old hotel in Bangalore. Would definitely go back to this place and try their sweets too."
5,"Oldest bangalore restaurant. One of the legendary vegetarian outlet. Still with same old ambiance. Food was awesome. Basavanagudi Area is famous for Old outlets like Brahmins coffee barMust try Ragi Dosa, Idily Vada, Masala dosa, Filter Coffee.Jamun n Carrot also niceMasala dosa is special here. Very crispy dosa."
4,This hotel is one among the LIGENDARY HOTELS in Bangalore teste is very good serves some authontic foods of Karnataka worth trying if your visiting Basavanagudi anytime.
4,"Ordered Veg Cutlet Sandwich, Peri Peri Wedges and JalapeÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå±os, Mixed Herbs, Chilli Flakes Cheese Garlic Bread. Delivered on time, packing was good all the items was hot.Now coming to taste sandwich was good, wedges had right amount of spiciness in it and garlic bread was also ok ok.Overall nice food.."
4,It's a pocket friendly place. For your taste buds will be satisfied with the food. Varieties of garlic bread is what we repeatedly try. And jalapeno garlic bread is our personal favourite!
4,"One of the best dishes I?ve had here is ...squid ghee roastFood is resonable ,tasty and worth for what you are payingTry out the boiled rice ,which you don?t get everywhere"
5,I am regular here this restaurant is amazing for karavali style foodies ..... supurb taste keep it up..... karavali food lovers like me do visit this place
1,Very worst food... don't waste your money...food also one or two days before prepared...I am asking biryani they r sending something like a jeere rice
5,Superb Mangalore style food with reasonable price and good packing.....karavali people sure order from dis outlet ...........................
1,very less mutton pieces. they only curry leaves
5,good taste and packing
5,good food
2,it's a gravy I had order masala

1,Did not get the prawn Chutney dry
5,good sevice.. on time delivery
4,"Mysuru's legendary mylari dose is now in bengaluru as the basavangudi mylari. Plenty of two wheeler parking opposite to the restaurant. Car parking are in the opposite or the perpendicular roads. Sagu masala dose was very neat here. Soft and crisp dose, sagu was very dleicous and generous as well, good amount of butter as well. Definetlet and must try for everyone.Service - 4/5Ambience - 3.5/5Taste - 4/5"
3,"Sunday breakfast we went to this place to experience sagu masala dosa.Waiting is less here. Ordered sagu masala dosa, karabath and butter idly.Sagu masala dosa was good but not as tasty as the authentic Mysore mylari masala dosa.Idly was ok not soft. Karabath very less quantity.Sagu masala dosa-Rs. 45Butter idly - Rs.20 + 5 for butterKarabath - Rs.25Taste : 3.5/5Service : 4/5Ambience : 3/5"
4,"One more must-try dosa place in Bengaluru.Serves limited menu which includes sagu dosa, plain dosa, idli with butter, khara bath and jackfruit kesari bath.Dosa will be melting when you take a bite. Sagu dosa is outstanding here. The taste will be similar to Mysore mylari hotel.It is a small place and packed most of the time. Service is good and the staff is friendly.Best bets: plain dosa and sagu dosa.Ratings:Taste: 4/5Quality: 4/5Pocket-friendly: yes"
2,"Be sure to be disappointed if you come here with high hopes of it's lineage (the Mylari of Mysore).However, the only good thing here is the saagu masala dose and chutney. The coffee was a forgettable one."
4,"This place serves Sagu Masala Dose, there are very few places where we get these. Instead of potato palya, we can find vegetable sagu, the doses are very crispy, the chutney & Sagu add more taste to it. They serve dose with a small portion of Butter, Sometimes by the time it reaches your table, the butter would have melt !!! Another specialty here is Idli, which are very soft, they serve it with chutney & Sagu, instead of sambar. We tried Kesaribath, was good. They have very limited items on their menu, probably due to place constraint. The place is small, can accommodate about 25 people, one needs to adjust to the cramped seating if they need to savor the sagu masala dose. Thumbs up to their staff, for ensuring customers very quick service."
5,One of those best places for Dosa. And so damn tasty. What's famous here is their sagu masala.You don't get the normal masala dosa. But their Sagu masala is outstanding.The dollop of butter just melts on the hot dosa. The freshly ground coconut chutney is a perfect combination with the dosa.We ordered idly too. Again you can ask for some butter on the idly. Soft idly with the fresh chutney .I also had the Kesari bath. It was ok. Nothing to rave about.Overall a great place for Sagu dosa and their chutney.Yummmm and delicious!!! Highly recommended!
5,Best place to have nati style non-veg especially ragi balls
4,the food tastes very goodbut not satisfied with serving they take too much timeover all its a good placefood ordered was biryani chicken and mutton
1,very disappointed with this hotel . dear owner am the big fan of your restaurant. but now days food quality and services became pathetic.... Plz look at about this . other wise brand name will get spoil .
3,"There's a reason why this particular restaurant which was once popular started losing their food business... And losing their customers day by day..""Quality and taste"" , though I sound a bit odd to those who love this restaurant..I have to be prompt while reviewing... Right? Poor lighting and ambience, average taste despite pricey menu, happy meal but not a great one..."
2,"Used to order from here regularly (the place has an attached bar on the main floor) for take home.The quality of food has forced me to skip frequenting this place.You'd want to go to a restaurant like this primarily for biryanis. If the biryani itself is not good, you know to avoid all the other random items on the menu.1) Take home order of nati biryani on an early sunday afternoon- the chicken was quite undercooked(!). Had to manage with just the biryani rice.2) In-house lunch meal with a friend was not good. Both biryanis were insipid. We felt we could have had a better lunch elsewhere (and for some odd reason, I had a bed bug bite me when dining in the restaurant. Why, how, bad linen, from the sofas? I have no clue).3) Take home biryanis were no longer consistent in quality.Would I suggest going here? Ordering here is a hit or a miss at times, which I'd preferably avoid."
1,Visited this place for dinner.. Its ok ok.. No food is worth suggesting.. Nati biryani was all tat I wanted. .. But it was not as expected...
2,"Manoj Raghu suggested this place.Abhishek Lakshminarayan and I went to this place to have proper nati style, all we got was extra salt in each and every itemRagi ball and chapati were the only item that was at it's best."
1,One of the worst hotel I ve ever visited. Careless staff members.. before starters they gave main course.. n quantity is very low.. no biryani at 2.30 on Sunday noon.. they say everything s over..
4.5,Visited for dinner.. N was very satisfied with the food quality n also price... Great pricing n all the starters was superb...v ordered prawn chilly.. Lollipop.. Fish fry.. Even the soup tasted great.. Biryani was ok...if ur biryani lover u might not be happy... But starters too good for that pricing.. Will surely visit again.. Even the service was very polite...resto is small with 6 to 7 tables but it was very private n quiet n other ppl cant see wat others r eating.. I loved tat the most?
4,Its a best place if u wanna have some spicy gowda style food....Ragi Ball is awesome here with mutton head curry and Nati Kodi Pulusu....These are the must try here..Its located in the prime area and u can find it easily..Biryani here is fine but not really great..Mutton fry was good...
1,Worst place for quantity of food. First and last time ordered here. Ordered 2 chicken biriyani through home delivery and got one biriyani in 2 containers. Not recommended for home delivery
4,If u are a lover of South Indian styles nonvegetarian food-then this is the place to visit...Place is too crowded at peak hours...Start with the Ragi ball and mutton sherva .Order some pepper of lemon chicken with it...finish it with biryani or white rice... Mutton Kheema is excellent...Service is super fast for the crowd they handle..Hygiene to improve by leaps and bounds..Meal for 2 costs Rs 600/-Parking limited
3.5,"Located on the third floor of the corner building, it's easy to locate..These people are specialized in cooking the different varities of biryani.To name few chicken biryani, mutton biryani, nati style biryani etc.., I have tried almost all of it but one thing is if you go little late, post their opening time it's not gonna be hot as it would have been cooked from the central kitchen, that would little disappoint your taste buds.I like their chilly chicken, it's well cooked cooked.The other chicken I would suggest is guntur chicken, it comes with bright red color but don't be scared seeing the color it's not as spicy as it looks.The service is fast.Ambience are decent..Overall a good place.."
3.5,"I tried mutton biryani and it was very good. Both the quality and quantity seems to be decent enough. Pepper chicken was very spicy, juicy chicken. Overall it's a good one, worth for what you pay..!!"
1,"Eeeeeew!!!Worst place.. Never eat here! Ever!!Really bad.. Worse ambience.. Entrance is bar and the restaurant is in the top floor..Coming to the bar.. You can see local ppl full tight :DNot a good place to come with family.Food is like a disaster.. We asked for mutton biryani and got chicken pieces in it. When we showed the Manger, he dint even tell a sorry... He was like ""lo Maga.. Change mado.. Mutton piece ilvanthe""Chicken starter was served with them chef's hair ( well a lot of things came into my mind when I saw that)And yeah Kalmi kebab :D Hahaha... you will forget what Kalmi kebab is if you eat here!! Beware of this place... I would rather stay hungry that eating here!"
5,"Excellent food , worth for money . Especially new Prashanth hotel special chicken fry was awesome. Very good service was provided . A place which needs to be visited again and again"
4.5,super tasty foods... biriyani is super nice maintained restaurant well supplying is fast nati items r more spicy pls make it medium that s all to say. over all is best for family's to come hear
1,"We have asked for naati chicken. It was not available on Sunday 9:15 PM. Very bad.. We came out. Though it claimed specialist on 'raagi ball and naati chicken', it was waste of time to go there."
3.5,"Have been visiting this place from more than a decade and can safely tell that the taste hasn't changed. Located opposite to NTT Data. This place is a small military hotel which serves some of the Most delicious Nati style food around the area. Boti fry, Kheema fry, Brain fry and Leg soup are few of the dishes they are good at . If one is not keen on ambience and want to try some authentic Nati style food, the above mentioned dishes will not disappoint."
4,"Good And Tasty food. Total 3Floors. Best floor is third floor, Service and staffs are good. Veg & Non-Veg dishes are nice. Good hangout place in Basavanagudi. Mushrooms & Chicken are best."
4.5,"They have 3 floors, 1st is a little cramped and always full but they have 4 led TVs to catch your fav match.2nd floor is primarily for family and a non smoking area, it's usually quiet and not crowded3rd floor is a newly built huge area, more like a covered roof top where the windows are curtains and has good breeze.The food is brilliant but little pricy, almost everything on these guys prepare is never disappointing. The staff are very warm and courteous but service is a little slow.I love all the starters. Neer dose/tomato curry or any side dish is delicious.One suggestion is please stop playing the same playlist from past 10 years, it's just a Kumar sanu and late 90's songs.They need to really mix it up.. the ambiance is great but pls pls change your damn playlist"
4,Best in taste. Ambiance is very good. Service is very slow.Egg pudina and red chilly mushrooms were lip smacking. Lighting is good.Service is slow...so order most of the items at a same time.. They will serve u one by one in a order.Pricing is not too costly.
3.5,"Had visited this place multiple times and taking out the time to review now. Typical ambience of a neighbourhood bar. Get quite noisy as the crowds start filling in. Ample seating. They dont take reservations on weekend. Try the top floor, it has good ventilation. Their menu is not updated, since we asked for Bira and were served one but was not mentioned in the menu. I ordered cocktails and were decently made. Food is good and is as per preference. They also serve the local cuisine. All in all its your usual weekend bar and not to be confused with a Pub."
4.5,Never did i know that this place existed !!! God damn how did i even miss. Their neer dosa n kori ghasi is to die for !!! And the donne biryani omg loved it. Will keep going back every weekend
4,"Excellent foodThe starters are amazingTry the egg pudina hereAnd the donne biriyani,dal khichadi,palak rice as wellExcellent ambianceTotally worth every penny"
1,"very poor service by the staffs. Biryani was horrible. Never visiting that place again ever. Shitty restaurant ever visited. Biryani was very greesy, staffs were not so responsive, the place was smelly, like someone had smoked in there. Never suggested for family visit."
2.5,"The ambience and lighting were good. However, the same cannot be said for the food and service. Had to wait a looong time for the food to arrive, and even the bill! The waiters were inattentive and careless. The fried rice had almost no salt, and the chicken noodles was tasteless. The green pepper was chicken simply covered in pepper (no, not the vegetable green pepper, simple black ground pepper). The price was not very cheap, but neither too expensive. Although, I think it was a waste of time and money. I personally have never been to another restaurant with such lazy and slow waiters."
4,"This is one of my favourite place to booze when I'm stressed out! I have been here more than 50 times and I like few things about this place.Service is good as I know few who work here. The staff are friendly.I love there diced chicken since I'm a very spicy eater. I highly recommend this. Whenever I visit this place, the staff get me this along with my beer if I just say ""As usual"".This is place is not just like a local bar. It is sophisticated and the ambience is good.Overall,Service- 5/5Food- 4/5Price- 2/5Ambience- 4/5"
4.5,One of my favourite restaurant.. me n my guy love this place .We get varieties in Sea foods n chicken as well .Good service goodQuantity n quality of the food is really nice .Donne Biryani they make is awesome damn tasty ?Me n my guy frequently visit this restaurant n we have sitting for a long time??
1,We are ready to pay tax. But that doesn't mean you can put 40 rs for 20 rs cool drinks. Do you think we cant be serious enough to sue you. I have proofs against you bloody people. Make money in a good way. Don't be stupid jerks. Paying tax is okay and upon that we need to pay double amount for cool drinks. ? For what? We can sue you. Don't think we don't have proof. We do have that. Bloody jerks
3.5,Nice location and a place where you get some good delicious food. The portions of some of the dishes are a tad on the smaller side is what I felt. This place does serve liquor and has live music on the rooftop if that suits your taste ?
4,Location of the restaurant is very nice and also it is close to my workplace. I am a regular customer to this place. Place has a got a good ambience. Food and drinks are serviced well. Friendly staff and their quick service will you amaze you. Only thing I am looking for is a parking lot.
4.5,"Pretty decent place.. Nice ambience, nice sea food, good drink?, mild music, and very friendly staffs.. but they dont have parking facility which is headache.."
3.5,Place is good. Food is best. The taste of chicken ghee roast was awesome. Only negative point is service. Till snacks n drinks they served well but service was very much show during main course.
4,"Its tough to find affordable bars with good food. Pramukh is the one. Cocktails were good. Chicken starters were so tasty, ask for more spice. Ambience is dull. Would recommend palak rice if not sure what to order because briyani is just another fried rice. No time limits as such, so chill maadi."
3,If you need both veg and non veg together at single place... you can try this place once.Food is average.Service is too slow . If you are planning for big family dinner consider at least 2 hours (minimum).
4,This is a small eat out near to my office and we discovered one of the best biriyani there.. Their biriyani unlike the usually served orange colored rice this is the less spicy light colored mughal style biriyani which you will never get bored of..so if you are passing through basavangudi or Gandhi Bazar any day pramukh is a must try.. And also this place is very pocket friendly and you can peacefully have your food there plus the service eis quiet fast too.
4,"The most regular dinner place during our college days. The prices are very less for liquor. Amazing malai kofta, triple schezwan chicken fried rice and masala kulcha. Mouth Watering. Not a place for a date for sure; but can become a permanent destination for friends."
3.5,A okay kind of place!With okay food and services!Food is not to great!Once in a while visit!But they have a good spread of kababs and different kind of gravies!
3,This is located in the heart of basavanagudi Gandhi Bazaar hard to notice since the streets are always busy...its a bar and restaurant with a separate family dining area... I was surprised to find the donne biryani which we find in military hotels in this place... The chicken starters were good not as spicy as expected... Biryani was delicious.. Ambience could use a little more effort found it a little gloomy...
3.5,"A dark setting of Bar cum restaurant with a family section and normal section on different floors. Was empty during Saturday afternoon which explains that people mostly come here in the evenings to drink. Not too much was expected of food after that, veg and egg Biriyani were ok in taste and Kadai paneer was too oily a gravy. Though non-vegetarian members of the group did like the Andhra Style garlic chicken and rice. Rates are reasonable. 4 of us are and drank a peg each in 1700."
4,"Pramukh serves best north Indian food in Gandhi bazaar. This restaurant has 3 levels, each with a bar. Decor is fine and crowd differ on each floor. Food is tasty and very reasonably priced too. Portions are good. Service is a bit slow sometimes. I've been to this place many times and their food never disappointed me, its rather a satisfying and fulfilling dinner.A must visit place to enjoy north Indian food with drinks."
3.5,Nice ambience and good place started with lemon chicken and prawns where quantity was very less but taste was nice and continued with panner and mushroom which was as same as chickenRoti and malai kofta was awesomeNice place and service was good as it was a rainy mid weekday eveningDrinks ? are affordable and served well...Not so heavy on your pocket..A good place to dine in..
4.5,Fantastic decor...great service and all the food we ordered were really seasoned well and tasty!..The paneer manchurian and baby corn chilli we ordered were real good...French fries were real hot and spicy!! Was surprised to see such a good place not seen by me fr the last few years since I ve been going right by it....Wil go back again for sure to explore more!
4,"Been here twice. Starters are good, specially paneer tikka and malai kebabs. Drinks are not so expensive compared to other pubs. Decent ambience. Service is a bit slow but this is the best and affordable non veg restaurant serving alcohol in Basavanagudi."
4.5,Best non veg eatery in Gandhi Bazaar. All tandoori dishes are a must try. Biryani is very tasty. Chinese items are also very good.The ambience is pretty good. Food served is tasty and hygienic. Cost is a bit high but affordable.
4,Cutting to the chase... Awesome tandoori and kababs at this place. Eat out your heart's fill at this place. The main course items also seemed pretty good. Ordered the butter chicken myself and it was truly finger licking good.
3.5,This place is with a difference.. Located in d busy lane of Gandhi bazaar.. At first it may just seem like a bar n rest.. But they do have the family space.. Food tastes good n is different from normal.. must try the chefs special stuffed mushroom..
4,Had been there a couple of months ago with friends.The place has great ambience with lovely food and beer. The service was good and fast. Had been there for a Sunday afternoon brunch.Definitely love to visit again especially for the non veg and the draught beer.
4,I was very hungry after my college .. me and my friend thought of visiting this place .. the food is really amazing .I really loved it . But the service is slow ... Overall I liked this place
4,Ambience and service is quite good. Lemon chicken and chicken sukka  must try :)You will find all Varieties of Manglorean food. little expensive but worth for money.
3.5,In a location that do not offer many non veg restaurants this is a pretty decent one.Its very easy to locate in the Gandhi bazaar main road next to Shivsagar. Lounge is on first floor.Second floor is the family dining area .I saw some posters regarding gazal in third floor not sure though.Ambiance:goodIts spacious and hygienic.Pendant lights gave yellowish glow to the interior.FoodSTARTERS: We ordered fish kebab and chicken sukka. They were served hot and wonderful at each bite.MAINS: CHICKEN Maharaja and Ghee roast with rumali roti and butter naan.All were equally good except Chicken ghee roast.Terrible !It tasted like some masala powder.Service:goodLe Shamin Anand !! Thanks for dinner :D
3,"To start with, the place looks shady with a very narrow entrance, even the interiors are poorly lit. Lounge and the restaurant are on two different floors. Love this place only for their good costal food, especially the Mangalorean food. Chicken sukka is a must try, they serve some very good neer dosas with kori gassi.!! Reasonably good pricing for a neighbourhood which hardly has any non-veg restaurants.!Food - 3.5 / 5Service - 2.5 / 5Ambiance - 3 / 5Value for money - 3 / 5Overall - 3 / 5"
3.5,"Good place to hang out with friends to have dinner. Has medium ambience, good value for money. Slightly slow service though.Has an attached bar, so a good place to visit after exams :-P"
4,"Let me tell you the story of my first visit to Pramukh.. One of my friend who had come to bangalore and thinking to go for nice dinner with Drink... Finally we found this restaurant, while driving. Surprised to see this in Gandhi Bazzar and finally went... There are 2 Floor, First floor with fine dining and good ambiance.. There is one AC dining area too, it was too crowded.. Then one of the staff said they have service at 2nd Floor too... So finally found some place to sit in 2nd Floor... Dining area is so neat and great ambiance.. Drinks were not expensive compare to other useless pubs in Bangalore... Food was amazing especially we ordered Panner Tikka, Gobi Chilly and Peanut masala... Coming to the main course, we ordered butter roti's and Dal Tadka - This is the place where i had perfect ""Dal"" and Veg Biriyani was so yummy.. Overall experience was good, since then i am going often.Taste: 4/5Ambiance: 4.5/5Quality: 4/5Service: 4/5VFM: 4/5bangaloreepicure.com"
3,Zomato is a life saver. First time in bangalore and this restaurant. Ambience is nice. Food quality is superb. more like bar than a restaurant.
3,"Even though the food here is laudable, the service has gone to waste, especially on weekends. An Okay place to have Indian cuisine and a few drinks."
5,This is one place I go every Friday
4,"Back to pramukhs again and, again they deliver exceptionally well. The starters included baby corn manchurian and paneer chilli. Masala papad was a sheer waste. The main course, the butter naan along with butter chicken was mouth droolingly tasty. The only offset being a tiny bit slow service and a better music would have been better. Ambience is good and again after the dinner, popped in a sweet pan while going back.----- 07 Feb, 2014 -----Would recommend this place over others if you are nearby Basavangudi. The ambience is very good. The food is exquisite for the cost. The only drawback being slow staff. It is also bar-attached and separate floors for smokers and nonsmokers. After the dinner, there is a sweet pan shop just below the restaurant. It helps you to finish off your meal. Would recommend it anyday except for slow service."
4,"First impression is the interiors. Good looking, decent with proper lighting,clean, and nice spacing for seating n walking space.Service is good. Food is good,tasty, and well cooked.Seperate AC room, and television screens everywhere is good during the times of cricket."
4,"This is an old hotel of South Bangalore, which serves good South Indian food and pretty good North Indian dishes tooIdli vada n masala dosa are good, rava idli is pretty good too.You can try bonds soup as well.North Indian food is like a typical fast food restaurant, prices are reasonable and service is pretty quick.So if you are looking for a quick fix breakfast/lunch/dinner and also a pocket friendly place then do visit here"
5,"This place is awesome and affordable,It's my favorite place, I am visiting this place since a very long time and never had a problem here with either quality or service, it's a pocket friendly place, very soft rotis and amazing gravy, the only problem is after Diwali or dusera it closes for a month or two months every year as staff go for hometown, these times I feel very difficult for sourcing a good place like this hotel which serves quality food without adding SODA especially5out5"
4,Well the food served is some what similar to Kamath Bugle Rocks however the food is much tastier here. Worth for money. A must visit place with family.
5,located in close to Gandhi Bazar and enjoyed food which was tasty and like home made food. vegetarians sure will like the food. will visit again
4,"This visit was long pending in my eatery list, entrance looks very small but the ambience and seating is acceptable according to the military hotel standards, I ordered chilly chicken, Ceylon parota and biriyani rice. Chilly chicken nati style was spicy as I wanted it and was good. The biriyani rice lived up to the expectations. The rasam given at the end was heavenly, a right finish to a good experience."
2.5,"I don't want to disrespect any of the small restaurants, after all food is food. I have been to this hotel several times when I had no other options, poor service not a good place for couples and family. Waiter tend to forget to give bills and makes you wait longer time even when he doesn't have much things to do.  Respect to the cashier, who makes things go smoother in that hotel. Ambience - poorTaste - averageService - depends *"
3,"This is one of the decent military hotels which serve Authentic Mandya cuisine (though there is nothing officialy as mandya cuisine) the biryani rice was good and the Kaleja was also good. The kebab was not soft and the masala was pretty less in it.The ambience is not that good, the service is just fine."
5,"Had a delicious food ,i liked mutton Kaima ball it was vary tasty."
5,Awesome place for best authentic mandya style nati food in bangalore i had visited ever..

4,the package was bad
4,Good tasty food.... Price also reasonable... I'm surprised to see such a lower rating for this restaurant..... Thank God I've not seen the rating before visiting the place....
4,Nice biriyani
1,Item was not delivered
1,"They couldn't care less about the service & attitude. Lackluster approach, they don't seem to care! All the negative reviews are justified. Don't ignore these reviews, they are bang on target!! Food is not worth so much of hassle."
4,"I'm glad I didn't see the ratings of this place before I ordered from here cz I probably wouldn't have tried this place. Tried the sholay kababs which were really flavourful and juicy and also very good quantity for the price. The mutton biryani too was good..wouldn't say great, but it was tasty. Packing very good with both the dishes coming in boxes and the raita and side gravy in well packaged covers. Would surely try the place again for more dishes and yes ofcourse, I'm sure sholay kababs are gonna be a constant!!!"
3.5,"Dear Friends,Please don't go by the bad rating. This hotel has been renovated and has got a new management. I visited this hotel for lunch. I ordered a Chicken Biryani & Tandoori Chicken. It's pretty good. But they have increased the prices recently and I think it's way too high considering the food.Quality: 3/5.Quantity:4/5.Price: CostlyAmbience:3.5/5.Taste:3.5/5.The staff is very friendly. The hotel is very underrated. Hope people check out again and rate properly. At the end of the day it's the food that makes the difference."
3,An okayish restaurant nothing special that can be mentioned. The ambience is average the taste is not that great. Pocket friendly place if you have a low budget.
4,Tried online delivery..food was good..must try...chk n sholya kabab is awesome..chicken was soft n juicy in boneless starters..pocket friendly
1,Bad experience. Not worth for the amount paid. The chicken biryani was so bad that we had to just leave it. Pathetic ambience. Quality=Zero!
1.5,Never order food from here!!!I shouldn't be giving even a 1.5!!Every thing about this restaurant is bad.Quality - 0Quantity - 0Staff not friendlyWaiting time is moreIt is said to be Mangalorean cuisine!!!I was surprised to eat chicken sukka there!!! I was wondering what it was...And fish fry tasted like dry spoiled ice fish!!!Don't mess with Mangaloreans... We know how fresh the fish is!!!
2.5,A non veg restaurant. A bit overpriced considering the quality and taste. Good service. Nothing great about food or taste of the food. Decent.
4.5,"This is a small outlet. If you are going with a huge number, you all won't fit in.Food varieties are very good. You should try buthai fry and bangda fry.it's delicious."
3.5,This s a small restaurant but they do have lot of varieties especially in chicken and fish.i like their biriyani very much and price also reasonable.rotti.parotta and fried rice all they have but they are not able to maintaining consistent taste.sometimes it will be good and sometimes will be bad.don't go with high expectations...
4.5,Foods they prepare r really good.. I really love it. Thanku koli mane for such mouth watering non veg dishes... And its also cheap.. So would like to go again :)
1,"Never ever take risk, this place is adjoined to main road full dust and dirty place, I see every day on the way to my place.........................."
1,"Never order in from this place. The delivery boy will try to fool you. i paid 60 rs for two plain rotis. And to top it all i had ordered a single naan. Very displeased. and the rotis were burnt. Pathetic. I would have given zero as rating if possible.I had ordered one chilly chicken , one chicken hyderabai and one single plain naan. i was given  one chilly chicken , one tasteless chicken hyderabai and two plain burnt rotis and was charged 270 rs."
4.5,"Worth it!!U get typical Mangalorean food here.Bhai log, jab budget kaam rahe na toh zarur jao. Space is very less but people wait for hours and enjoy their favourite dishes. Neer dosa with any semi gravy chicken dishes tastes awesome. Especially Chicken sukka with neer dosa is #awesome # mouthWatering. Do visit guys!!"
4,Mouth watering food especially neer dosa ..amazing food at pretty good price
4,"If you love Kolkata rolls, it doesn't get better than Belly Squad. Their biryani is also very homely and nice. The boys running it are very polite and nice. Didn't love the momo chutney but other than that its become my go to place for spicy chicken roll. Been thinking of trying their new introduction like chilly chicken and Lollipops.. Keep up the good work guys!"
5,"Good North Indian resturant, foods are delecious, taste, food taste like home food, nice ambient.,staff is very polite and they provide nice food and service"
5,Nice and calm place....This place is for persons who wants to eat good and light food. Good for tummy. The food will give you a home meal feeling.
3,"Ambiance - It's a hole-in-the-wall kind of outlet that serve chats, juices and other light eats.Service - Gets crowded usually in the evening, so expect some wait time.Price -  Moderate.Taste - They have a great variety of options on their menu to choose from.Listing some of the items that I have tried :Floating pani puri - Must tryNannari soda - Must tryFloating masala puri - Very goodOreo milkshake - Good"
5,"Cheapest, Bestest, Largest rolls in Bangalore.And talking about the taste. This is the place for rolls. Only problem is that there isn't any place to sit."
3,A small place which serves yummy rolls! Inexpensive. The best is the double egg chicken roll. Goto place BMS students as it s right behind the hostel and easy on the pocket. Only one guy manages the whole shop and does quite a good job. Won't score very well on cleanliness although i won't call it unhygienic.
4,"This place is a one man show. The owner cooks, serves and settles the bill. The rolls here are amazing and I have been his loyal customer since day one. I have always ordered two egg chicken rolls which are quite filling. The only downside to this place is that he is almost never open. He runs away to his native place for vacations all the time and comes back whenever he feels like. If he was always open, Rolls Corner would be such a hit. This place is a blessing to people who want to fill their stomach up without emptying their pockets."
4,"This store recently relocated to new shop very near to old one. The rolls here served are good on taste as well as on pocket. There isn't much of the dine in available here. As this is very near to BMS college, expect a rush hour between 1-2:30. The serve time maybe late cause the cook has to do all the work by himself."
3,This place is so small and so isolated but everyone in BMSCE will know about this place. The person makes huge rolls and has more than 10 varieties. Taste is decent and you can fill your tummy in the half an hour break which we get. This place is usually crowded may be because of its cheap prices which makes it affordable for everyone. Good place for a quick snack. Hygiene is something you won't find here and if you're too concerned about health I'd recommend you not come here.
3.5,Good place for breakfast nd lunch...Menu shows so many variety of dosa...Bt u wont get it all d tym...Nd the place is always crowded nd we hardly find ny place to sit...Food is tasty nd worth d money...quiet cheap compared to other places...Over all okok ntng great abt d place....
4,"One stop shop for cheap and easy to fill your stomach. They offer a variety of sandwiches, omlettes, varieties of maggi and shawarma.They make fresh fruit juices too and theyre made to your order fresh. So are everything else.Recommend - 10/10"
3,"A fairly new place to eat, on the Bull Temple Road. The food out here is decent. Worth the price.Their breakfast was good. Had idlis, which were nicely made. Their Sambhar has a tinge of garlic, which I personally didn't like that much. Coconut chutney was decent.Coffee needs more ""dum"" in it. Though it's manageable.Evenings they serve the usual chats. Need to try and figure out how it is."
4,"Had been with friends here! An amazing place to hangout with friends. Good music, drinks and food. Pizzas are good too. Worth the penny ! Ambience is good but the smoking area is congested. Fries and burger is good but the bun quality is bad. Overall itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a good place to drink and have fun."
4.5,"Amazing place.. good to hang out with friends... they Have happy hours till 7.. good food , Ambience is also good...Food: 8/10Ambience: 8/10Service: 7/10"
3,"Bad bad experience, firstly the way the customers are treated it was a pathetic experience,Ambience:3 out of 5 since they have this in mind that they are best around which is very very wrongFood:3.5 out of 5 , not bad starters taste was good and spicy"
3,"Ambience is too good, and one of the best pub in banashankri area and it is pocket friendly as well and taste is not that good enough and service is too slow"
1,"Very rude service. My first 10-15 mins experience was waiting at the table unattended. I had to look around and find someone and call them over to my table. They donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât understand simple things like two small drinks make a large. He argued that a large plus large is not possible in gold, two smalls plus two more is all I get. The food was served only warm, not hot enough. The bill came up to a very unhappy sum for all the bad experience"
3,"I've been to this place quite a few times. Love the music here being a lover of classic rock. Its filled with college crowd. Car parking might be a problem but you can find spots right in front of the place for two wheelers.The food used to be really good but the taste has been deteriorating. I used to be a big fan of their paneer chilly but they changed their menu a few months back and they've removed the item itself. Even though they have chilly chicken, they refuse to make paneer chilly. They don't allow any modifications in their food menu. Pizzas are a safe option since they can't really mess that up.Fountain soda in the mocktails is good.Still like the coming to the place since it has a good vibe. Prefer the ground floor since the seating and lighting is better."
4,This place was having such a lovely ambience and it was pretty good place to hangout with friends but now they changed the ambience.. I don't like new one actually anyhow here food is very delicious ? service is very good and they have some refreshment game too and all good.. anyhow good place and good staff ?
4,"I was just going through Zomato to see what places in the vicinity I haven't reviewed. Was surprised to see that I hadn't reviewed Jcubez. This place was our go to place when I was a student. Pocket friendly, close by and had happy hours too. Had quite a few good outings here. Even now if you ask me for a place in Banashankari to chill and grab a drink, I'd suggest this place. But this is more for the college crowd. Loud music and dim lighting. If you want to have a conversation with your friends, it's tough because the music is too loud most times. I'd recommend this place."
4,"This place is definitely a must visit! A pleasant ambiance along with courteous staff and amazing food! The quality of the food was ? and the portions were more than enough for two.We had ordered fattoush for salad. It had a tangy dressing but I loved it.For starters we had ordered mutton kebab. Soft, juicy succulent muttons accompanied by hummus and mayo.For main course we had ordered kashmiri pulao. Go for this if you're okay with your rice being sweet. This had apples, pomegranate kernels and pineapples. Of course this had to be served with something spicy, so we ordered chicken tikka masala with it.Also, we couldn't eat all of this, so half of all of this had to be packed!Overall,Food 4.5/5Ambiance 5/5Service 4/5"
4,"Well I was here for dinner with a gang of 8 and I loved the experience.Lets get straight to the point.There is good and bad.So lets begin with good which is more.Food is very good, we ordered grill and a lot of other things. The food was a complete good experience.Now bad which is very littleThe ambience is very very dark for a family dine in. Restaurant. I strongly suggest to use a brighter lights. And where we sat right above that that tiny little light had gone off but we were able to spot the food.And the service, the staff is friendly but I think they were short of 2 or 3 coz we literally had to call out loudly and felt happy when a service person walked by.But all In, I recommend this place for a decent family dine in. I would surely like to visit the place again and hope the lights are up."
3,"What I Had...1.Murgh Kalimirch>Taste : 3/5>Serves : 2-3Boneless Chicken pieces marinated in Cashew and Black pepper marinade and grilled giving it a mild spicy flavour2.Pahadi Murgh>Taste :4.5/5>Serves: 2-3Chicken cooked in a sweet-spicy gravy of onions, tomatoes,spices and fresh cream.Goes perfectly with butter naan.3.Chicken Biryani Hyderabadi> Taste : 2/5>Serves : 2-3Disappointed.It doesn't taste like the authentic Hyderabadi Biryani.The chicken was also dry.The service is quick but the staff isn't much friendly or responsive. Ambience is good. The location seems perfect and their food is good. Recommended for Pahadi Murgh and Laal Maas."
3,Yum-Yum!Delivery Review!I had ordered Mushroom Masala and Rottis from here the other day. Never expected it to be tasty though. It was delicious. The mushrooms were smoked and cooked in the curry. It was a good meal. Looking forward to try their other menu options.
5,Been there with family and the ambience is awesome food is amazing especially veg biriyani is awesome and the staff are very friendly going to visit this place again
4,"Recently we visited Fattoush BTM but came out with disappointment, but doubtdly visited Fattoush Bannerghatta Rd, We tried their buffet lunch it is quit surprising that they are doing good job with respect to taste and number of items, we are very happy, and I would recommend to visit Fattoush Bannerghatta Rd and try their buffet, it's Great and Amazing."
5,"Mouth watering hummus laham, crazyyy mouth filling gold duck.. No I am not referring to a duck but to an ice cream Sunday. And very refreshing orange juice. I ordered in room diningshiulichakravorty.com"
3,Three stars only because the food isnt half bad. The starters here are actually pretty good. What put me off though was the service. Lax and not accomodating. They let us take a buffet 15 minutes before closing (we werent told) and then made us collect and scarf down our food in 15 minutes. Please improve your service!
4,A wonderful place for a grt evening. Really good arabic food they have got. Very good service. Nd the desserts were also nice. Excellent ambience as well.
5,I had ordered chicken tangri kebab and biryaniRecently I hardly give a 5* but I lover the tangri kebab so so much I would have given a 6*. Must try. And definately this would be my usually ordered dish... keep up the tasteThe biryani was good 3&1/2* for this. Long grain rice which being a north Indian biryani lover is my biryani expectation...However the tangri owed a 5*... cant rate it below 5 for now due to the unforgettable mouthwatering tangriAnd definately gonna try this restaurant again..
4,"Was passing by This area and noticed a small cafe on the ground floor of this property that belongs to Fattoush. They had some amazing all day American breakfast and some lovely sandwiches. Surprisingly the taste was good, the prices are decent. They also have a spread of desserts and coffees."
5,"After reading a lot of reviews, i finally decided to try this place.This turned out to be a pleasant surprise. We opted for the buffet which had a decent spread with a veg soup and non veg shorba, salads both veg and non veg. The starters has two varieties of chicken items along with fish. All of them tasted good. Had an amazing time here. Thank You!"
4,"Hello everyone!! I had been to Fattoush to try the Arab food festival going on der.First tried we had a mango lady, passion mojito, Virgin mojito. The mango lady and passion mojito is the must try mocktails here.Creamy chicken soup was little heavy but it's finger licking good. Don't miss it if you are a fan of soup.The must try in this place is the hummus accompanied with freshly made pita bread and salad. Hummus be the first most important thing you have to try here at all seasons. I loved it.Now the mandi items. Chicken Kofta, ozzy chicken are top notch.And the Arab sweet platter was the perfect thing to finish the meal.To sum up, Fattoush has come with a really good menu for the Arab food festival which you should not miss.Taste - 4.5 /5Service - 4/5Service - 4/5"
1,"I was denied food , according to zomato and google maps and everything online they open @12:00 . Upon my arrival i was denied of food , they told me it opens only @12:30 , if so they should not provide the wrong information on the world wide web . Really really poor service. The waiter challenged me to go ahead n post a review he dint seem like he cared at all. People like this are the people who destroy the reputation of a establishment."
4,"Food was awesome. However, if they improve the ambience then that would be great. Ambience is ok ok, feels like some maintenance is needed. Staff is courteous. Nice place to take your family or friends."
4,"It is located near IIMB, Bannerghatta road and very easy to locate. It was in my list for long and finally i could make it last week.Their menu has lot of options ranging from Indian to Arabic to Chinese.We ordered hariyali Panner tikka and Irani chicken tikka. Panner tikka had nice smoky flavor.And chicken was also cooked with perfection and it melted in mouth.In main course we ordered veg biryani and it was more like pulau but rich in vegetables and quite flavorsome.Ambiance of this place is good.Their service is prompt and they play instrumental Arabian music to get a feeling of Arabian place.Only one thing which they can improve is their cutlery and serving dishes."
5,Amazing place! The food is so tasty. And the quantity is huge. The staff is very nice. One of the best places in bannerghata. Love it! Highly recommend you to go here.
3,"I was here for the dinner their ceylone egg parotta, crispy chilly babycorn and kuboos are very good. Nice place to dine out with family and friends."
3,"I was bored along with 4 other friends and we decided to dine here.I loved their hummus and kuboos.They make a lil disappointing baba Ghannouj.The service is not very professional. I expect more enthusiasm and effort.The food portion is also small but it is cheap food but if they can increase the portion size with the price, I'll feel less cheated.Overall, good food and a poor experience."
4,"I have been coming here for quite some time now, and every time the food amazes me. Mostly i come here to have their Arabian dishes and really fond of humus and kuboos. Also really liked their ceasar salad. Good location, easily accessible, a nice ambience and polite staff."
2,"Food was average. Portions were not very stomach friendly, or maybe we were just way to hungry. Price range is decent. The service can improve a lot."
1,"1 star because the food was ok. Apart from that the service was pathetic. First our complete order didn't come. We mentioned to 3 different waiters that we have still not recieved the drinks, but no one was bothered. Post our meal, no one bothered to come and refill the water glass. When asked for bill, we waited 15 mins but again nothing. My wife and I walked up to the cashier/manager and complained to them, again, they were least bothered. We waited 10 mins but then finally left. This is when the waiter comes running after us asking for the payment.Never going back to this place. The 4 rating on Zomato would be due to their own people rating it like that."
2,"After having liked their food before, visited this place again today but was highly disappointed with the portion of the food served. Attached is the picture of the Tandoori mushroom starter. There were hardly 10 pieces of these tiny sized mushrooms in the dish served. We asked them to replace it but all we received was the same dish with just 3-4 extra pieces. If you're charging a heavy 240rs atleast make sure the quantity served is right.Veg Kadhai had a pungent flavour of coriander seeds with the vegetables being just onions, capsicums and green peas.Probably won't visit again nor recommend."
4,"Visited this place specifically to try some Arabian food. The ambience is quite riveting with beautiful lighting. Getting to the food, the Irani chicken tikka was quite a dish, very tender and perfectly cooked. Chicken tikka gravy was rich in flavor and was absolutely delightful. We also ordered chicken biryani which was excellent as well. The staff is friendly but I'd prefer the to be a tad quicker. Overall a great experience :)"
5,First I used to order their food from online....Love their Chinese and afghan food especially..After that I visit for the special occasion...Thanks to their service team making our day special..on a special day with a special person..If u like Chinese noodles don't miss here..super..And if u are non vegetarian try their lamb and mutton very tasty..And I really appreciate their honesty and loyalty to the customer..I forgot my newly buyed ring..they keep it safe and give back to me..thanks a lot...
2,"I had chicken biriyani.A good biryani is known by its rice, Sorry Fattoush you are not serving good quality rice in the biryani. I would say masala is ok ok type , not very good.Chicken pieces are good, it was soft.Lot of improvement is needed."
5,"In the mood for some great non vegetarian food?Head to Fattoush right now.Fattoush is located in Bannerghatta Road close to Vega City Mall. It has a very Arabian kind of feel to it.Its perfect for family lunches and dinners,.The food is absolutely delicious and decadent.It is extremely rich.To start off..Starters - Crispy Chilly Potato, Tandoori Veg Platter, Barbeque Chicken, Tangadi Kebab, Pan Fried Chilly Fish.We absolutely loved the Fish and the chicken. They were cooked perfectly. The veg platter had a variety fo tandoori starters.Main Course - Kadai Paneer, Paneer Butter Masala, Dal Makhani, Egg Peas Masala with an assortment of breads and biryanisThe gravies were cooked in butter. Our personal favourite was the Egg peas masala and the paneer butter masala.Desserts - Sitafal Cream, Mango CreamIf you go to Fattoush and don't try these desserts, you are at loss.Must try!Perfect family lunch restaurant"
3,"Kinda fancy restraunt, in Bhannerghatta main road and is not difficult to spot. it's located in the first floor.Walked in for lunch buffet, the food was pretty ok, nothing too special for its kind. It had limited options epically for vegetarians, 2-3 starter, 2 types of rice, veggies, ice cream and cake. But for non-vegetarian they have extra 2-3 dishes, sick definitely is tastier.Air-conditioned hall with formal dine in, very spacious too. kind staff.Food - 3/5Ambience - 4/5Service - 3/5Recommended for casual lunch or dinner."
5,An Multi Cuisine Restaurant with really kip snacking starters & mocktails.Excellent taste..we tried Veg Platter & Crispy chilly Potato.Mango Lady mocktail (seasonal) was stand out.The main course was good too.The standout was sitapal cream..an great place with setup & reasonable too.They have wide non veg options too..
5,"Buffet Lunch @ Empire Restaurant is Great ? Food is Awesome, I would like to recommend this to everyone who loves Non Veg @ BudgetFood 5/5Service 4/5Ambience 4/5"
5,"If you want sumptuous food for less price, you have to be here. They have spacious ambience. Good service. We had ordered for a Empire special chicken Kabab and chicken chilli among starters, both were very tasty, chicken chilly was a Lil spicy.For main course we had Ceylon parotta and their special boneless butter chicken, the parotta was soft and good. The butter chicken was filled with boneless chicken pieces which was soft and tender.Then we had ordered for Half ghee rice and half biryani rice, this is one of their best thing where we can even order half portions when we want to try both the dishes. We love the ghee rice there. Ghee rice and butter chicken combination here is the best, this taste cannot be found elsewhere.The biryani rice was OK this time, thought we should have ordered the ghee rice instead. Overall nice food with good portions.One word - A Value for money place.!"
2,"The first time we ordered chicken popcorn pickup from the Empire restaurant, food packaging is good coming to the taste it's not up to the mark.> Taste: 2/5> Delivery: 4/5> Packaging: 4/5> Value For Money: 2/5"
4,"This place really gave me a pleasant taste after long time. The varieties I ordered were usual ones Paneer butter masala,jeera rice and Kulcha.It was nice but what I loved most was their combos (good in quality and quantity for a dinner). we ordered box 18 (veg gobi manchurian ,kadhai paneer,ghee rice),box 20 (chicken biryani boneless,popcorn kebab and raita) and box 23 (ghee rice,paneer butter masala and gobi manchurian again). these were so delicious in taste, you should try these if you are looking for daily food. I specially liked the ghee rice .The packaging is perhaps one of the best. Loved the personalized containers and neat labeling.Nitesh"
4,"I particularly like this outlet more than others. It is bigger and has better service and wider timings.The food is just like any other empire restaurant but the service is better. It amazes me how they are able to manage so many people so easily. Very impressive. The food we had was a whole grilled chicken, onion Paratha and butter chicken. Food as always tasted good in all carte. The buffet, as I know from before, is disappointing.Overall, good food and a good experience."
5,There is nothing different when compared to other Empire restaurants when it comes to food or service. But this place offers a pitcher of flavoured slush kind of drink. I could not find it in the menu but you can ask the waiter and they will facilitate. This has been a favourite for every customer who knows this place and you should try it as well
2,"Quantity very less.taste ultimately worst,all over has to be my most pathetic ever experience of paneer bhurji, 2 stars for the respect that I have towards Empire, so if folks veg food is your thing then empire is definitely not in your list"
3,Tried their 200/- buffet which included good varieties of food. Wish that the taste would have been better. Also the buffets stalls needed to be regularly filled once it was all over. Service was a bit slow. The staff is very good and friendly.Parking lot is available for both cars and two wheeler's.epicuresdelight.blogspot.com
5,We are regular and we love to have food in empireAnd we also get some new dish wich they call chiken wings it was so amazing and the compare to privous service today its more than so we are happy thanks
5,"Had Ordered Egg dosa with Chicken curry.. and on deserts, fruit salad with iceecream and arabian grape juice... wowoeooe. ultimate.. Homely taste.. very nice... delicious.. would definitely order again :) Highly recommend it.. :)"
2,Best part about this place is that it is open until late night. We went on the time of Ramadan and ordered fried food.The Chicken was very bad and it was just battered deep friend chicken. I ended up leaving most of it.The fish was well made with good taste.
5,Today i decided to have food in empire hotel and went as planned !!!I I have ordered idiyapam and chicken it was so tasty loved it !!! Budget was as we planned !!! Good food ....Hygenic
2,"Okay I would like to start off by saying that this restaurant has a team of unorganized workers. I ordered food online and it was 4 boneless biryanis and I received 1 mutton Biryani. When I called them, they said that they cannot do anything about it as that is what they were told to send and they already received my payment so they couldn't care less.Horrible service but the biryani tasted good. 3.5 for it but service made it a 2."
1,we ordered 4 portion boneless chicken biriyani and we got only 3 Biryani when i called the restaurant people saying we can't do anything.they doesn't know how to talk with the customers... But the Biryani was really good.. for the Biryani i wud like to give 4/5..thanks to zomato care they are very co-operative...
3,Average place with some average options and average taste. Service is slow and it gets unbearable because of mosquitos. Go in a daytime to beat that but overall an average place to go specially for eating.
1,"I have booked a ""T"" cottage on 30.05.15 at 9 pm and checked out at 31.05.15 8.30 pm. All the facilities are worst. 1. No cottage keys were given to us. We used to just close the door without locking while going outside. 2. No hot water 3. No cell phone charging point 4. Swimming pool was not chlorinated 5. Big hole in mosquito mesh, from where all the insects entered in the room. 6. Security came kept pestering us to allow AC technician to work inside, while my kid was sleeping and she was sick. It is disturbing our privacy 7. Even we reached before 10am for breakfast all varieties were got over and they served only poori to us. 8. Water leakage from geyser in bathroom 9. No mosquito repellents were provided. 10. Manager (Gopinath is not customer friendly) Over I never want to visit or suggest your resort"
3.5,Oh very long back this was our college hudda... Nice place... Good food... Good rooms... Great place for party time...
3.5,"Tulips resort off Bannerghatta road is one of my favourite resorts in Bangalore. I love the drive and I love the place itself. The food is delicious and the prices are less than what you'd expect. The location is great and you can have a lot of fun if you go with a group of friends. The service is on the slower side and sometimes eats into your patience. But by far the biggest drawback is the staff. The staff on site is friendly and polite but the management staff are untrained and outright rude. It feels like they are trying their best to scratch your ego and provoke you. With that exception, everything else is perfect."
5,"It is awesome place. Staffs are so friendly. Music is quite good. I think No need to talk about food because the name itself saying that , the barbeque in the town. Water melon n pineapple barbeque z my favorite. Complimentary birthday/anniversary cake with music dance n lods of wishes. U will love d place."
5,"Vibrant and good vibes most of the time. They have really friendly staffs and who performs their services promptly. Food served is really tasty and full of flavours. The fact that they serve wide ranges of starters, it fills the stomach in that, so I would suggest people with great Appetite must have. I absolutely enjoy Prawns grill, and love the fact itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs unlimited. Things like keema Partha, rotis are missed..if not asked for, so ensure you ask the staff there.Desserts are yum..especially brownies, Gulab jamuns and the unusual Paan kulfi?Also like the sweet gesture portrayed by the staffs on occasion of birthdays.. where they sing a birthday song and get a small cake to be cut"
5,"Starters, starters, starters. Wow, that filled me up completely. The main course was a push. And yet, these starters were so delicious, that I did not long for the main course. Anyhow, the buffet had a wide variety if dishes, would not ask for more. The show stealer is the dessert section, break into it."
4,"A very nice and good place with best buffet in town. The staff were very humble and polite, the food was good in taste and quality would recommend this place at any time."
3,"Chef and Waiter were very polite and courteous but food wasn't as good as it was in electronic city outlet. Too much of red chilly was put in every veg n non-veg starter. Though after I asked for no red chilly, They obliged but damage was done.They should ask if someone is allergic or doesn't like, which was done at electronic city outlet"
4,"We (25 people) were looking for place for impromptu dinner and this place rescued us with 100% satisfaction, taste and service.It's always a pleasure to visit this place at any city to satisfy your taste buds and its very reliable.Service is the best thing about this chain and it always amazes me.Suman repeatedly asked what variation would you like with starters and one of my friend wanted to have something marinated in black pepper and he made sure chicken black pepper was ready for my friend after some time.For me BN means - lots of non vegetarian starters, crunchy corn, fried baby corn and roasted aloo in starter, No main course, in dessert small gulab jamun with vanila icecream and at last Pan Kulfi and I am all set.Thanks for being wonderful all the time irrespective of Hyderabad jubilee hills, Hyderabad financial district or JP Nagar Banglore...its always great to dine in BN."
5,Plac eis quote good ambiance food was fabolus and the started with freshly made starters food quality was never better just waw people are supporting really helpful customize the taste spice according to your need speaclliy thanks toSoydul sameer for excellent serviceMain course have good choice for veg as well as non vegQuality was just splendid (excellent)Desert was very much better and melting in our mouthOnly issue was small place to accumulateJust the purpose was served good ambiance
5,"It was closed on the day of my Birthday i. e 25th November. So we went today for post birthday dinner. Had non-veg buffet.Pros- Unlimited chicken, mutton, fish Berbeque's. Which was fresh and extremely tasty.Dessert counter was filled with- cakes, gulab jamun, ice-cream, live kulfi.Cons- Biriyani had no chicken.Need one welcome drink badly. Since it's a large buffet. At lest try to serve fresh lime soda as complimentary drink.Server's are extremely helpful and polite. Great experience ?Abhisek Gayen"
4,"Redefines barbecues with a plethora of fine options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The tikkas were really tender, but anything mutton is tough to chew. So better to avoid those. Desserts were good and so were the multitude options in kulfi. Biriyani, surprisingly, was passable. They need to come up with a better version. Live grill on the table is a highlight and memorable experience. On Service: Khush served us impeccably and with a smiling outlook. Big thumbs up.On decor: very casual ambience and almost every table had someone celebrating an anniversary or birthday"
4,This is my go to place. Barbeque Nation never fails to disappoint! I like their starters good variety of chicken starters. Like their desserts. But this time I really liked their assorted Kulfis. The best ??
3,"Had been to this place last Friday.I didnt find it so great, the service was too late and the staff who served us looked so dull. Not sure if he was not well or he's like that always. Not much to comment on that.Food is good here, liked the desserts part.May be the day we went was too crowded and so couldn't enjoy the food properly.Want to check out this place again since there are quite a good number of reviews and see if it's really that worth.Waiting forward to meet the staff and food again."
5,"The best BBQ nation in the town, I must say. What a charm the waiters have, what awesome food they serve. Veggie people have less options in any BBQ you go, but this place will make sure you have a good amount of quality veg starters on your request for free. Sometimes, they have complementary drinks with the food. Check with the staff for that."
5,"One of the oldest places that started off the concept of in-table barbecue, this place has stood the test of time. Be it the food served or the service offered, Barbecue Nation is a great place to head for good food. We went here for a family lunch and were seated promptly. We were attended to constantly, asked for our preferences, how we liked our barbecue, could the spice/flavouring be altered to adhere to our tastes etc. Our attenders were friendly, warm and prompt. We had a variety of starters, all of which were quite tasty(both veg and non veg). The main course and desserts were good too. Nice place to go, if you want a nice barbecue."
4,"Best barbeque compared to all branches in Bangalore, it seems you have entered to a new world, went 4 times , food serving is fast, as like the food is very nice and hygienic, well keep the good service"
5,"I visited 2nd time to your restorenr food was really good with nice tase,fruits, biryani ,chicken all items are very nice with special taste ,serving is very good I prefor your restorent to come again and again...."
5,Awsome food the starters was really good i have tasted one potato Cajun it was really awsome and !!! Coming to biryani it was not up to the mark !!! Food was awsome
4,"Best Starters and Desserts !!!!!!!!Each and everyone visiting this Restaurant will have a very Unique Experience of having full lunch with only starters and Desserts.The starters are too good to resist just with one or two.Even the Management has decided to make it more unique by providing a Flag for each table.They keep on serving the starters until the flag is brought down.Once the starters are done most of them directly jump to Desserts.The main course is the usual Roti & Rice nothing special.Even though it s bit costly, it fully worth to visit once for the Barbeques."
4,"Good food, friendly staff and nice ambience. Have visited this place on several occasions and have never been given a reason to complain. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs in your best interest to make a reservation else there are high chances that you will end up waiting."
5,"One of the best place in every city to have buffet, you can get alot of varities with good taste , i just love the starters of this place , with lots of deserts ?"
4,The food was good... Rahul was the one serving us and he was very courtious as well. Overall enjoyed the experience here. Recommend this place for groups.. Will definitely visit again..
4,Had a wonderful night being here and they served us customized fruit grill which was awesome. I would love to visit this place again. Kudos!
4,"Food was really good, i was into veg buffet, there was only 6 starters, and the rice biriyani was good. Then dessert was really coolService 4/5Food 4/5Ambience 3/5"
4,Best place when someone is ready to give party.. food taste and quality is never compromised.. drinks is little costly but the taste of food takes it all.. most frequently visited place
4,It was an amazing lunch with my colleagues. I love this barbeque outlets since itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs the only place where I feel where IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâm equally empowered like non vegetarians as there are so many options and I love them all.Everything about this place is super cool and happening.Loved it to bits be it the dessert or the egg curry is the best egg curry I have ever tasted and also the ChatÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs were amazing and there is an amazing buffet with an amazing range.Ambience - 4/5Taste - 4/5Pricing - 4/5
5,"The service is above and beyond expectations. They try to accomodate every small request in the most polite manner.Needless to say the starters are amazing, main course is definitely good, and a wide variety of desserts to chose from gives a perfect ending to a great mealMy top picks from the buffet menu: Prawns, Aloo tikki (the one which comes with cream), Roasted Corn, Mutton curry (don't remember the name)A place definitely worth visiting when you are celebrating any occassion as they make it special with a cake (complimentary) and a nice dedicated song"
5,"This place never disappoints. We have been frequenting it for years and not once have we had a chance to complain. . . . . Yummy Food, Fantastic Ambience and Excellent Service! Enough Said!"
5,"If Veg food tastes so good, one can eat this everyday.?Gourmet veg food at its best.Be prepared for a long wait on weekends and holidays. Really bustling (noisier than the other branch) with white walls and Isckon graffiti which is packed most times.The latest addition of Appam and stew is a winner. Sweet toothers celebrate here, the dessert spread is as much as the main course."
5,Had been here for dinner with my family. Seeing the pictures only you can just imagine how amazing is the food.You should be a complete foodie to try all the food items available here.Special mention to the desserts here. They are just yummy and melt in the mouth kind. I ate 90% desserts and 10% other food items.All in all itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs the best place to have some nice and innovative veg buffet.The price is worth it if you can stuff yourself with all the food available there.
5,Nice place for pure vegetarian food. It's completely jain style. But you will get lots of options there and they have really done an excellent creativity. Love the foodFood! 5/5Service :5/5Ambience :4/5
5,"After a very long time I actually enjoyed a buffet dinner. More or less the menu remains the same despite what such restaurants often claim as completely different, largest spread etc. This one IMHO however stands out the tallest. Excellent selection of food, amazing flavours, brilliant arrangement! Service standards are top class, the pace at which plates were replaced, I was totally impressed. The restaurant is spick and span with ISKCONish graffiti on the wall. Every item of food we liked barring the pastries, which we found considerably hard. Italian live counter, we skipped. Gajar ka halwa without sugar was what I liked the most. Given its commendable quality, around 650 RS per person is definitely bang for the buck. @Meghana"
5,Great place with great range of Veg food..right from starters to chat items to main course and desserts...little on the expensive side but worth it....I loved their pani puri and gajar ka halwa specially..
5,The pics cannot justify the appeal and flavour of this place. The options are tasty and well cooked. Best part is the portion size of some dishes
5,"Looking for a decent buffet place in South Bangalore? Then sattvam is the one! This satvik restaurant with Jain cuisine doesn't disappoint you. One of the best buffet places in Namma Bengaluru. They are very famous for the way they serve the food.It has Italian,south Indian, north Indian and what not! Do check out my photos to have a glimpse of what all it consists of! Don't miss to dine in this amazing place! Food is great and ambience is amazing."
5,"Well, this outlet is also at par with their sadashiv nagar original set up.Yes we have to compare this joint with itself.No onion no garlic food, still such a large buffet with equally delicious and tasty. Presentation also rocks, specially their base for cutlery, buttermilk and pani puri.Nice ambiance and peaceful music. Rather I would say satvik music.Entire staff is so hospitable that you would enjoy your time and food more.Though they donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât use onion and garlic, they instantly prepare for jain starters avoiding potato and other roots items even though those are not in there menu. They ll make something or other to cater to jain starters need. Their curries are anyway as they mention it -ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâjain friendlyÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ.Delicious cakes, deserts, sweets, finger licking daal makhani, sunhari makai malai, awesome coconut rice and curd rice and what not.No words can describe the experience there."
4,"My parents insist on going to restaurants that are completely veg and we were skeptical of this place.What an experience though! Yummiest food I've had in a long time! The variety, the taste, the service! You guys made our day!"
4,Very nice place for vegetarians... So many options n almost everything available there was too yum.. they have a wide variety of options available n the service is really good n the servers were very courteous.. it was a good experience ? will go back there again when we don't feel like eating non veg..
3,"Heard a lot about this restaurant and finally gave a try with friends. Wide menu with a number of dishes. They only serve buffet, A spoon or two with each of the dishes will fill your tummy! Fine ambience, During my visit experienced some of the noisy crowd - can't do much about it. Tastes good for a satvik. If you are looking for a no onion, no garlic and no masala food, Go for it. Definitely over priced but for a occasional visit, It's alright. It costed 3000+ for 4 of us on a weekday lunch buffet with 2 leamonades."
5,"One of the best veg buffet you will find a Bangalore. The ambience is excellent and presentation of each food items is awesome and carefully thought of.Even though you will find only Lemon rice, Brown rice and curd rice in smaller cookers and buckets, a must try for all because of its cuteness.They have variety of deserts and sweets which very few restaurants have in there buffet.Ratings:Service - 4/5Ambience - 4/5Kid Friendly - 4/5Value for money - 3.5/5 (It is little on the higher end)Overall experience - 4/5"
4,"Had been to this place with family on occasion of my nephewÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs bday . ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a Jain friendly restaurant where they cook without garlic and onion. Our course started with a sweet corn soup which was decent. The the starter platter which had paneer , bread and two types of kebabs . They were good enough . And for bread there were many options on curries . Each one was worth trying . And then can the panipuri but they just have Il us one puri each with a unique plastic bulb with pani from which u can only sip with a straw. It was good but I wish they gave more . Jaljeera was ok . There were many Indian sweets and cakes . Cakes werenÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât that much worth a try . Pizza was prepared and stored to heat and store so they were hard .Ambience: 5/5Service 4/5Food 4/5Cleanliness 5/5"
1,"All I can say is this is overrated,hyped and expensive and is not upto the mark with so many veggie friendly competitors around JP Nagar. One cannot survive with decor, miniature / presentations. It's ultimately quality and taste that matters. They can reduce the number of items and concentrate on other aspects.People who are eating pizza, pasta, chats ,etc , there might be no complaints as such. Even I don't have complaint about the taste of all the gravies, curries as the taste and opinions vary from person to person, Personally I didn't like though.They kept almost uncooked basmati rice for jeera rice. Using short grain for fried rice and that too which is not properly cooked is not acceptable.They could have short grain for jeera rice and basmati for fried rice instead. Rotis are too hard. Few of the starters were good.Basic main course was not properly taken care of. Pathetic experience. My first and last visit."
4,"Not everyone will like the food here, this food excludes onions, garlic, ginger, potato and all other root veggies. The spread was good and the service was very prompt. Clean and hygienic place... a good one time experience."
4,"I had read lots of mixed reviews about this place but finally decided to checkout on my own. The buffet has only veg and saatvik bhojan (Sattvic diet is a diet based on foods in Ayurveda and Yoga literature that contain good quality) so you might feel it is not as tasty as other restaurants. They also have Jain friendly dishes.The special dish available here was Amrood ke Sabji (Guvav curry) which was surprisingly good and new. There was also Sattvik kofta, paprika Paneer and Alu Mattar which was as usual. They also had live counter for Indian breads, pizza and Pasta. There were chats too, Pani Puri, dahi Puri and Papdi chat. Biryani was flat, it was Sattvik Biryani so couldn't expect much from it.Coming to desserts, they were the 'Man of the buffets' every dessert presented were delicious and melted in mouth without any efforts!I wouldn't say a must try restaurant but can be visited once for a change!"
4,Easy to locate.Comfortable seatings.Friendly staff.Buffet is great.Quality is appreciated.The thin crust pizzas are curries are great.A good pick.
5,Buffet in 24th Main is really ultimate. After searching and tasting many restaurants in Bangalore we decided this is the king of all buffet and dis will be definitely heaven for Persons specially who loves Andhra food. Starting from starters to desserts each and every item is super . Mr Narayana Murty he is the chef for main course he is worth of big applause . Even there is no negative point in ambience and service . Guys I do strongly recommend every one to taste it .
3,"Been for dinner tonight in 24th main , this restaurant located in main road ; we can easily access this place!They have valley parking options also?Ambience is pretty decent and good?Staff are very good ?Service is excellent ?I ordered masala papad , papad was over burnt I told the Steward he replaced and give me the good one and it was ok ok!Ordered paneer 65 it was very tasty and good ?As main courses I ordered tandoori roti and paneer tikka masala ; again the same roti was over burnt in tandoor and tikka masala was very yummyBecause of our burnt roti , we didn't enjoy the food and i gave 3 star due to quick service and paneer 65"
3,I visited here as many of my friends recommended this place for dinner (veg) .. I assume there has been deterioration in the quality of food ( oil used was smelling). It was not tasty as I presumed it to be.Ambience is good and service is good but there is definitely scope for improvement in taste.
4,"It was great to be here with my college buddies after 8 years and we selected this place on spot. The service was quite good, polite and well manared. The buffet lunch was good interms of spicy, tasty and yummy which I really liked it. Though I'm pure non-veg boy, still managed to adjust veg food with my buddies for a day. Fried corn took my heart!! Dessert was yummy. Enjoyed every single moment.One suggestion - At present tomoto and mint is the only soups available. You can add few more soup items in menu which ppl like it most.Thank you ??"
3,"Not at all worth for money, service is too slow in here ?food is not that good totally waste of time and money don't ever visit this place."
5,Nice and friendly staff.... Ambience is good with some grt food......definitely worth a visit if north Indian cuisine is what ur looking for. They serve good quantity of food so make sure u don't end up ordering too much and not to forget theres a nice place to sit outside the hotel.
4,"Ambience okayish. Food- certain items are good while certain are okay. We had ordered pudina paratha, garlic naan, kulcha, veg Tripura, kebab and honey chilly potato.All items were good except the potato which was extra spicey and weirdly sweet.Restaurant has both buffet and ala carte. Buffet is well spread too.Restaurant is not very expensive and the staff are well mannered. Our bad luck that the table where we were seated did not have table napkin or cutlery and we had to explicitly ask."
4,"Family restaurant, pure veg, reasonable price, buffet.They have both North indian & south indian food with some Chinese items. They also have chats.Food tasted yumm. Service was good. Ambience is average with good music. They have many varieties in starters, main course and desserts.Very nice experience..."
3,"Ambience: averageStaff attentiveness: ok okFood: Above averageValue for money: 5/5A simple restaurant situated close to RV dental college. Ambience was average however the food was decent and above average with some good and ok dishes.The buffet is priced very decently at 450 per person. It contains a soup and few starters. Live chat counter. Pudina paneer tikka, dragon roll, crispy corn, and gobi manchurian. The main course contained roti n naan which were soft and fluffy. The side dishes/curries were average. Paneer, gobi matar, dal and saagu. Neer dosa is something they donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât know how to prepare. The South Indian spread was good too. The desserts section was spread out with yummy gulab jamun, rajbhog, and carrot halwa. Overall its value for money with loads of waiting people."
5,"A pure vegetarian buffet restaurant that takes its name from the location it is at. We visited here a couple of Sundays ago for lunch and got to taste the delicious vegetarian dishes. From the starters to the main course, there was a variety and the service was impeccable.foodnwine.in"
4,"One of the fewer restaurants offering good Vegetarian Buffet. The food quality is obviously above the rest of the restaurants serving Veg-only buffet. Good spread, of both North Indian and South Indian cuisines. The ambience is classy, kinda old school. It was a Sunday afternoon and the place was packed. We saw a lag in the a la carte service, because the place was full.Quite a few options on the desserts and starters, which was impressive.A good place for a lazy lunch with family.Food: 4/5Service: 3/5Ambience: 4/5Prices: 3/5"
4,Good family restaurant with pleasant ambience. Starters were good in buffet. The quality and taste of the food is fine. Buffet here is for a reasonable rate rather than a la carte. Service is good.
5,"Bedridden and after scouring through a number of restaurants for satiating my piping hot soup cravings, I landed onto Zaitoon's page. I had a hard time deciding to order from here coz the options are plenty. I ordered for a simple Chicken hot n sour soup. It turned out really amazing, the taste, texture, balance of flavours were just on point also with the ample amount of chicken and veggies it had in it. Im honestly craving for another bowl of it right now. Just a word for the packaging, it probably can be made a little better than what it is. The plain white run of the mill container did no justice to whats inside. Jusssayyin!"
5,"If it's time for Arabian, it should be zaitoon. The best Arabian in d town. Staff are very friendly and have good knowledge of dishes. They will suggest and explain food so well. U must try."
1,I ordered special chicken shawarma roll which literally made me run to the loo. It was spoiled and I threw it. Spoiled food from a reputed restaurant!
4,Ambience 9/10Food 8/10Service 8/10Zaitoon in JP Nagar is a two floor building with the first floor for dining and the 2nd floor is a party hall. The location looks very grand on entering and they have a take away shop in the ground floor. They are known for thier grills and meat dishes and this is one area that they do not disappoint.They serve a wide array of cuisines from Chinese to indian to Arabic. All their food is good for the price point. This location has a buffet which is priced at 599 and for that price it's extremely worth it. There isn't another buffet in the city that offers prawn fish chicken and lamb in the starters and in the main course for 599. Some of the food is under salted but I think that is because most Arab cuisine is on the blander side. Zaitoon also has an amazing offer during Ramzan where they give a box with meal for just 399. That is also delicious.I would rate this restaurant 8/10
3,"Had chicken shawarma, chicken plate special shawarma, malai chicken kabab and tandoori chicken from here.Tandoori chicken was very juice and well done, a little on the hotter side.Plate shawarma was good, but came with only one kubbus, was a little surprised at that. The regular shawarma and the malai kebabs were tasty.The price point is a little bit high, compared to the quantities, but quality is pretty good."
5,Probably the barbeque chicken in the city(its a must have).There is always a rush in this place and still they manage to accommodate everyone :).. the food is really good and service is also faster.Must haveBarbeque chickenPrawn xacatiZaitoon special tandoor chickenAlso its a mod priced restaurant and doesnt burn hole in your pocket ;)
4,If you visit this place then Zaitoon special chicken barbeque is a must. You would definitely like this. This is very soft and the taste is great. One thing to see that if you are coming to this place for trying out this dish then you have to come little early on weekend since during late night it might be finished. So if you don't want to face disappointed then try to reach before 9pm in the evening. Also soup is really nice. Tried some other dishes but it's just ok not that great.
4,"A restaurant with nice ambiance,great food and no bull. Located at a busy area with ample space for two wheeler parking. Not sure if they have car parking.Sparsely crowded at lunch time with people trickling down even around half past three. Waiters are well behaved and attend to you quickly.Went with what to order on zomato and it didn't disappoint.Hummus falafel and half barbeque chicken for starters and a Mutton biryani for main course. Hummus was finely grained and coupled well with falafel. Barbeque chicken was awesome and a must try. Mutton dum biryani is good but has strong tomato flavour.Meat was cooked just right and it was falling off the bones. All these with no pinch on the pocket. Great Arabian food indeed."
4,Amazing food.. just ordered Zaitoon spl barbecue for home delivery.. it was great.. just loved it.. juicy and soft with the right spices..loved the way how the portion was cut.. tender and delicate.. when u order this item u donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât need to order any main course item as they give kubboos along with hummus and garlic paste.. for the food what was sent definitely a 5 star rating.. salad was missing as not a piece of veggie was sent along.. that was a little disappointing.. delivery time within the specified time.. pricing slightly higher..
3,Not a very friendly restaurant to visit. Waiters are not too helpful to organise for 5 of us walking in. But they serve delicious food. The dal makhani and palak paneer was delicious. Rotis were crisp. Veg biriyani was great. Great value for Money.
5,"I been here twice ? I like this restraunt very much ? decent ambience, superb service and food is really tasty ? we ordered Al famh chicken and chicken biryani both are mouth watering so good and service was quick.. friendly staff cheers guys and keep rocking.. must try restraunt and I love the chicken biryani here ?"
4,The best Mexican shawarma roll ever tasted. Mayo and spicy are extremely good. The service is also good and the service persons are very polite. The ambience is also very good.
5,If you are located within 5km of this place then you might know that there were are not many buffet options in this area so this is a very good option nearby without driving too far in traffic.The 25 items variety mentioned in the menu section are definitely served. about 8 varieties of icecreams flavours.Value for money.  You may go on weekdays to avoid crowds.
4,Ambiance of this place is really nice. We visited during the weekday and it was very quiet and calm. Food wise it was tasty as well. Variety wise not very large buffet spread but very neatly maintained. A little difficult to locate the place if you are not familiar with the area. Always use maps.
5,"Warm ambience, Spacious area, plenty parking, unlimited food, good food. You can't possibly fault this place which probably ticks all boxes quite neatly. The buffet spread was pretty wide and you can go crazy with the 8 ice cream flavors alone! Try each and you'll have yoir last penny's worth already!.A must visit for family dos and as well as a silent outing. Can't really say if there's anything wrong with the place."
4,"Serene ambience, almost open space covered with lot of plants. Really a green place. Good place for corporate or group. Friendly staff. Mango greens is branch of Mango tree, Green for vegetarian buffet and Tree for non veg buffet. Liked the concept of seperating veg and non veg Buffets. Usual trend of review is to start with starters, but main course in this restaurant has topped over starters. Liked texture and taste. Akki Rotti and Ragi Rotti were today's special roti, to be frank these roties were really fresh and tasty. Overall good starters, good main course, good desserts. And fresh fruits. Liked it?"
3,"Nice place filled with lot of green plants , trees and open space ... food is clean and comfortable, we had mushroom italic , broccoli soup both turned out to be great, main course was a bit let down with too much of tomato curry over powering all other spice ... staff is friendly"
4,"That ""wow"" wala Punjabi taste is what I was looking for and this is the correct place to jump in.Authentic Punjabi flavour of malai paneer tikka and chicken tikka is something you should taste here.The food is simply awesome and and I have ordered the lassi here that is also something too much for one person to finish. But they took kinda more time to prepare the food. But I think that is acceptable when you know that a great food is coming on its way.Ambiance-4Food-5Service-4"
3,The food here is absolutely delicious. Do visit if you are looking for authentic Punjabi food. But whenever I've been there the buffet was always closed. Service is very very veryyy slow.Great food but not so great experience.
5,"Very very very very very nice service.Food was north indian and punjabi, and i loved it because i am from delhi ??Every north indian punjabi should definitely try this place ??"
1,Worst set of experience which makes me think give 1 star for the restaurant.Rudest and No experience staffInternet explorer is faster then their serviceTasteless and cold meal pakkaPlease don't consider this place with the familyCheers
3,"Decent place and attempts to bring you some real dhaba like feels. Prompt service, good butter chicken and naan. I've obviously had better, while not completely disappointing the place doesn't deliver as much as the name suggests it would."
4,Just I can say is it's an authentic Punjabi style restaurant. Ambiance and taste and hospitality all fine but the problem I had is only the quantity ... Only 4 pieces in regular starters. At the cost of 250+ change... But the taste was good and mild.The lassi shots was awesome ... And handi curry was also mild and rightly spiced ... And here comes the jalebi and rabdi ... Oh gosh that took me to the different zone .. that juicy jalebi was spot on ... Enjoyed a lot
3,"The ambience is nice with some bollywood and desi tinges.The food is okaish, not too good. The service is sub-par.We ordered makke ki roti and Sarao ka saag. The saag was nice but makke ki roti tasted as though there was wheat flour mixed in it.Paneer tikka was not as flavourful."
1,"I wish I could taste your food, but your manager went missing today and the cashier was more confused than the day he got married. We booked a table at ten for four pax.. I did notice a the staff being short today. I saw a table being empty for more than ten minutes and the same was not allotted to us.. the security could not allot cos he had to ask the manager. And when we asked where the manager was ÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâSir aaj woh nahi aaya haiÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ !!Kudos guys... awesome experience."
2,"Today been here for dinner, we ordered masala papad and Punjabi paneer tikka so first they served masala papad , they just fried and gave I guess? papad was not at all fried properly, Punjabi paneer tikka big slices and paneer was so hard? again we ordered for main course like kadai paneer and roti almost he took 25 mins to serve ; I asked pls server as soon as possible that person telling me other table order is going on wait? this people don't have manners to speak with guest!! However we waited , finally he served kadai paneer and roti. One of the worst kadai paneer ever I had , no spices , totally tasted like sweet dish.. waste of money, food service is very slow and I had very bad experience ?"
5,"Heard about this outlet from my friend and visited it next day. We ordered mutton seekh kabab and bhatti da murg. Taste was delicious. Nice blend of all spice. For main course, we ordered mutton roganjos. That was also good in taste. But the main highlight for me was onion kulcha and patiala Lassi. This is best lassi I had in bangalore. A must visit place."
2,I couldn't find anything so be too good for a second visit. Also frlt like no much options in starters.Chicken felt not fully cooked.The starters felt mostly the same.Got a jilebi free for posting on Instagram
4,This is the best place for North Indian cuisine!I love their buttermilk and raita because the quality is too good!Paneer starters are very good. One must try paneer starters.They have great parathas. At times you might feel too heavy but itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs good.One must try dal makkani ?I donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât recommend biriyanis.Ambiance is decent.Service is great.
1,Pathetic services. Food is not all that great. Would never recommend this restaurant. Food ordered came after 45 mins that too post multiple follow ups.
4,This place is perfect for a Punjabi whole some food . So this was the second time I visited and I again loved it . I ordered chicken shorba or chicken soup and that was tasty and yummy . Perfect texture and blend of spices.Then I ordered amritsari fish and that too was mesmerizing. And it was awesome to me because I love fish as I am a Bengali.Next to main course was butter chicken as that's an all time favourite chicken dish you could order without thinking too much . It was tasty enough .Ambience was great . Cleanliness was also great .Garlic naan could have been a bit more better since the taste of garlic was somewhere missing. value of money was maintained.
3,"Disappointed with the restaurant. Service was terribly slow and the staff didn't seem to respond when we were calling them. We ordered chicken Tikka masala with butter nan, which is kind of the base of Punjabi food, but even that wasn't good. The naan was very oily and chewy and we couldn't make out any flavors in the Tikka masala."
4,"Really liked the food here. Restaurant is well ventilated with a cool atmosphere, unlike Koramangala branch. We had ordered a lassi malai maar ke, which was delicious, dal makhani, Lahori dingri/malai kofta, amritasri kulcha and cheese naan. Every item was worth the price. Only reason to deduct one star is the extremely slow service which might be due to the rush hour."
4,Lassi was amazing. Chilly Chicken was nice some kind of fusion with Chinese I felt. Cheese naan was really rich in cheese and really tasty. The mint chutney was super. The kheema chicken curry was really good too. Biyirani was just ok had the Punjab flavor but could have been better however quantity was huge. Only reason why I reduced a point is because the staff could have been more friendly else an easy 5 star experience
1,"It was a disastrous evening at Our Amritsar. Inspire of booking the table in advance the staff made us wait for roughly 20-25 minutes. I could see 3-4 tables empty but the staff was reluctant in getting the tables cleaned. The service was very poor. Had to wait for almost 45 minutes for the main course. Paneer Butter masala and Hara Bhara Kebab were good. I have visited other OA outlets in Bangalore, the service is much better at the other outlets."
1,Don't ever visit this place service is too slow and the staff over here have no idea how Zomato gold works and more ever food quantity is soo less and taste is soo pathetic ? don't waste the time visiting such lame restaurant not at all worth for the money and the staff was rude too
3,"I will give a 3 star rating. It has good ambiance, but the food is just ok. Didn't like the taste of food here. I've been to a lot of good Punjabi restaurants, felt the taste can be far better is what I feel."
4,The food is excellent. Specially the biryani was good.The ambience is good. But the starter we ordered was a bit less . Nevermind the main course made up for it. A must visit in this part of Bangalore
4,"Food / Drink - Punjabi.. (balle balle, may I say!).. Truly North Indian restaurant in Bengaluru. Curries are spicy and flavourful. Could be better though. Breads are yummy. Lassi is good, wish it was a little less sweet. Overall, decent place for North Indian food.Price - Priced according to competition. Nothing exciting in terms of value quotient. But.. not exorbitant either.Service - Decent. Responsive staff. Food takes a bit of time to arrive though. Plan accordingly. Not much wait time on weekends. Funny story.. I had to get my bill corrected thrice..!Ambience - Good. Tables are well laid out. Quirky posters on the wall. Dummy bullet to make you feel like Punjabi.. Would that get you to do balle balle.. I donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât know, you tell me!Location - On the ORR.. close to Bannerghatta Road.Parking - Street. Not sure of on-site parking.Speciality - Punjabi food. Lassi.Must try? - Nah! Better Punjabi restaurants available.Pro tip - Check the bill presented to you!"
3,"Decent ambience & food (tasty , medium spicy & oily ) . when you are on punjabi cuisine you donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât count calories - just enjoy the food . The time taken to serve could have been better ."
2,Was a regular at their meenakshi mall store a few years back before they closed that one down. Was very disappointed with their food today. Had a prawn starter which was basically a dry curry and not the tawa prawn we expected. But the mutton Rogan Josh ( or its equivalent name here ) was VERY disappointing. Seems like they have changed the cooks along with the store and have bad food at very high prices ( the mall prices were reasonable ) . Not going back .
3,Want to give it 3.5.Nice and quiet ambience.Food was good. Loved the soup. Disappointed with dessert. Ordered litchi rasgulla dessert. Great concept but very very sweet. rasgulla was also dry. looks beautiful though.
5,Awesome food. Mast ambience. Buffet z really good. Buffet only available for lunch. Dinner is alacart. I must say staff are really friendly. Service is fast.
3,"Visited for lunch on a weekday. The ambience is lovely and it was not very crowded too!Started with the monchow soup. The soup was quite good and served with crunchy noodles. For starters, we ordered onion rings and batti paneer tikka. The onion rings were crispy but quite oily, and served with sour cream. The paneer tikka was bland and should be avoided.For mains we tried Thai and Italian. The green Thai curry is quite good and is sufficient for 2 people. The Arabiatta pasta was disappointing, the sauce was watery and the pasta itself was over cooked.We had gulab jamoons for dessert which was okay. We then had litchis that were stuffed with rasgulla and served in rabdi. ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs creative dish, very sweet and can be tried if you like the fruit.Service was quite quick. This restaurant is quite expensive but food isnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât up to the mark.Taste - 7/10Ambience - 9/10Service - 9/10Value for money - 6/10Taste"
3,The place is Very near to my office so office luncheon happens here .They have good variety of food in their buffet menu but the only issue is that they don't change their menu.
4,The ambience of the place is amazing !The food is really good. A variety of dishes are available. A bit expensive. And itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs not very crowded. Worth a visit
4,"Melt - Eden Park has an amazing cuisine range. The restaurant has a great variety of non veg as well as veg starters. They serve Basil in almost all the courses, even water. I wouldn't recommend Chinese here, except the dimsums.The basil cooked chicken starter was one of them, and I absolutely loved it. The other dish that I fell for was ""chakuri murgh"" that's an Afghani recipe I would vote for if you are planning on going here.The food no doubt is great. I would rate it asFood : 4.5Service : 4Ambience : 4.5"
5,Ambiences was very good and please also really looking like food quality was good testing and services great experience all is excellent so thanks for. EDEN Parks
3,The ambiance is good and the food was decent but the service is really slow. You got to wait for them to refill the plates during buffet and after a while the appetite kind of goes.
3,"Great good, good ambience, poor service.We did try both Chinese and Indian and food was exceptional.Badam Aloo tikki was the only let down I the other wise good food afair.The wantons were great, crispy vegetables spicy and soups good.The north indian gravy was good as well.Garlic naan was okay but preferred they serve with butter.The service was very slow and we had to request them many times for service and orders."
3,"The ambience is good. Food options are less for vegetarians. Taste wise it's good. Service is good as well. If you want to go for quick team lunch, this is the place."
5,"ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a really good place  Just as the name suggests, a wonderful place I heard about this place many times and I finally got a chance to visit"
5,I had been wanting to visit this place for a long time and finally got a chance to visit it.  A good place to grab some snacks and drinks in the evening
5,I have been to this place many times and there are some dishes are really good.  I had been wanting to visit this place for a long time and finally got a chance to visit it.
5,By far.....A must eat for me on a weekly basis at least. Great food and good ambiance very good. Must try Restaurant.  Loved the pizza. It was fresh and was clearly made with a lot of love and care.
5,Great food and good ambiance. I liked peri peri chicken steak the most. Pizzas are also very good.Staff are very good. Must try Restaurant. Shall visit again
3,I have tried the chicken ghee roast and chicken biryani. Biryani was average and ghee roast chicken was hard and chewy. Overall an average place considering the food. Ambience is good and staff is pleasant.
3,"The restaurant is having a great interior decor & ambience, however the waiter or the person assisting the guests often misunderstand the food type that is being ordered. For instance, as I ordered Biryani of a certain variant & asked not to give the green one, they gave the green one itself. But, the fries & Burgers are awesome!!"
4,"I would give this place a 3.75.I had visited this place and had a buffet and it was really good.The food tastes good,very friendly staff,quick service of breads and beverages and an ambient place,what else do you need for a perfect family lunch.The starters were very good especially the fish and squid even in the main course fish was the major highlight and even the appam dosa they give is also very good.The deserts are basic which has 4 flavours of ice cream.Overall a good experience on visiting this place."
4,First of all the concept inside this restaurant is awesome with some cool interiors.. The ambience is great.. I loved all the non veg and veg dishes ordered and they were super spicy.. Needs some improvement on speeding up orders..
4,"This Mangalore based restaurant is an ultimate experience for any seafood enthusiast.This place serves a whole new range of seafood, mutton as well as lamb and crab preparations.The food is great and tastes good.There is a seafood festival going on, I would highly recommend any seafood lover to go and have an experience. The service I felt was a bit slow.The ambience is good."
3,Food is awesome..the place remains too crowdedService is too slow...confused staffsso if u have to eat dinner u need to b thr during lunch time
4,"Nice place for a good wholesome meal. I appreciate they accept special requests BUT I asked for no ghee, no butter, no milk in my veg curry to make it vegan, but unfortunately they donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât understand vegan fully and added paneer. If they can learn how to properly cater to dietary restrictions this would be a big perk! The place is clean and generous portions."
4,It's one of best restaurant in jp nagar.i have been there couple of times . The decor is very good .Food has an authentic Kerala as well as Mangalore taste.panner ghee roast and chicken ghee roast is a must try.I have tried most of the dishes here and all of them were good.The prices here are also pocket friendly even if you go for buffet optionThe only negative point they have us the service which is very very slow after ordering you have to wait atleast 30 min for the food to arrive.
3,"I would call it a average place for a buffet, taste was not upto the mark for the price we paid starters were serviced on the table making things slower than expected just got 2 veg starters and 2 non-veg starters and not a wide variety to be precise and after a long delay..They had told us it will take 10 min for the buffet to be arranged not a problem could have kept up to the expectations with service and taste of the food..Gave 3* for the ambiance and 10% discount that we got in the bill.. which couldnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât justify a 5*..Thanks for hosting us.. Hope to see you people again sometime, might have a better experience to write about.. :)"
4,Very much fine dine restaurant in JP Nagar. Their soups are really nice.Starters are their speciality. They serve coastal food majorly. We ordered Paneer Ghee Roast with Khali Dosa. It is the best ghee roast I ever had in Bangalore. Dosa were very soft and thin.The Mix Veg curry was prepared little different than normal restaurant. It was spicy but never felt like too much spices added.Tandoori Roti platter was enough for 3. It included various rotis n kulchas.They have one of the best desserts. There Choco Mud cake is very unique. It is exactly opposite of choco lava cake. It is cold inside. Their Gudbud ice cream is must try for families specialy.The restaurant is for Families and Couples. You get a good privacy and peace here. Definitely JP Nagar has got a new cool place to hangout with Family and Friends.
5,I usually visit here since itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs very close to where I stay which is located in jp nagar ....pocket friendly worth for the money.....good taste I have tried lot of items in veg nothing turned me off....u have lot variety of food here under one roof I think u all must visit here and I would love to visit here again and again even staff here is very friendly pl
4,"Spice Code by Check Post is a fine dining restaurant with good ambience and service,the menu has good options with decent prices and we tried crab soup,tandoori chicken,chicken butter roast,chicken roll, chicken fried rice and naan and the taste was good with decent quantity & would recommend this place for a quick break!"
5,Good ambiance and above all very very good food .Quantity and quality up to the mark . After quite long I have found an indian restaurant in which I loved every bit of dishes that I ordered.We ordered sweet corn and tomato soup .In starters we ordered veg spring roll and baby corn tandoori .Main course we ordered chilli milli sabji which was interesting and quite different .they served it with two kinds of gravy chilli and milli and it was too yummy .We ordered vegetable pulao and that was equally good .would keep visiting this restaurant and would recommend for the rest to try out if not already tried . :)
3,Had been here with colleagues for a seminar n then lunch...Small buffet....no much options in desserts...food quality is okay...cost is reasonable...not a great place o buffet. ?
1,Quality Inn is the worst 3* hotel in Bangalore with good ambience maintained badly and we went for dinner buffet and was served old and rotten food and the spread of the buffet was poor!
3.5,"This restaurant is an absolute delight when it comes to the ambiance.  Low lit lights with Rajasthani paintings and arch make it an aww altogether. Food was good, interestingly, what we ordered was just not of the regular taste and a hit to our taste buds. I was happy with the service too ! They are open until late night and definitely a must visit for the night eaters."
1,Worst service ever I had seen in Bangalore. The food came after more than 1hr. The manager was not entreating the request and one order also they gave wrong who CV c we have not ordered.
2.5,"This place simply survives on past glory and the present is a complete paradox, at least the food is!The items in the menu are mostly repeated everyday and they are a hit or a miss depending on the chef's mood but it's usually the latter.I liked the idly, utappam and sambar and the omelettes at the live counter. The interesting part is that for some reason they don't have this live counter on Wednesdays.The service is good but I feel sorry for them as they can do little if the food itself is not up to the mark. The refills are not done on time and when they are, it looks like they are trying to cut costs everywhere. The hotel itself is usually full due to the convenient location inside the by lanes away from the hustle and bustle of the main road. Give this restaurant a miss as there are many other better choices in the vicinity!"
2.5,"We tried buffet and on the contrary it was just ok food. There was nothing great on the food which is worth mentioning.However the courtesy by the staff and polite nature is worth mentioning. I wish they improve the food by hiring a good chef , which is very much required. Thanks for listening."
1,They delivered a stale Biryani.Worst biryani I ever had.
4.5,"Amazing place to go and enjoy north Indian food, visited this place with my family and they found it much better than a few other restaurants in the area!Service : 4/5Food : 5/5Ambience : 4/5"
5,"I had been there on a Saturday, so there weren't much crowd. would recommend to family and friends if you want to have a pocket-friendly buffet lunch. Excellent food and services, thanks for Pavilion team member  and  Chef"
4.5,"Just wanted to appreciate the wonderful experience i had while celebrating birthday party of my 2 year old daughter (Charvi) at ur restaurant on 16th oct 2016.From booking till organizing, everything was so smooth that i never expected this kind of service.My special thanks goes to Mr. Sujit Bose who has personally taken care of everything from start to end. While i had other hotels in mind to conduct the party, it was purely because of sujit that i chose quality Inn after having the initial round of discussion with him.Thank you quality inn bangalore team."
1,"Had been there..nothing worth to value of money..horrible service,bad management ,food served was very late and served cold...n found small cockroach in veg biriyani.....and water bottle with a cost of rs40 was priced at ..rs110..don't even dream of turning up there.."
1,"Had been to this place about 4 years ago when it was called 'S Hotel. We were impressed by the beautiful ambience and decent food then and so went there yesterday and realised that it's only the ambience which is still good.The food , the less said ,the better. We choose the buffet and realised that there was just one veg and one non veg starter. The maincourse was nothing special .The desserts were a disaster.There was jamun and stale brownies .And when we asked for ice cream the staff were clueless and wanted to know if all of us ( 9 people) wanted ice cream which they grudgingly served . The only nice thing was the chats which they served one each - a pani puri and a sev puri for a table of 9! It was quite pathetic given the fact that the buffet was priced at 550 bucks! We could have just walked over to MTR for a nice hot lunch for less than half the price."
1,One of the worst places you can be to enjoy your time. The staff are too slow . The food!!! I can surely tell that you would waste your money for that. It was surely a horrible experience. They don't know how to treat guests. How can they book a whole restaurant for a child's birthday and only 2 tables full. The staff takes no initiative in cooperating with us. Think thrice before you go there.Lastly please do no visit if you are a foody person... U will curse it!!
1,We went to this place for dinner. They serve soup and starters at the table. They served momos which were spoilt. The other starter was also not good. After complaining to the staff they served another starter which was ok. The main course was bad. All the curries tasted very bad. I had a stomach Upset the next day.I would certainly not visit this place again and I would never suggest this place to anyone.
1,"We chose this place after not being able to make it to BBQ nation on time. I have no hesitation in saying this was my worst buffet experience ever. Unprofessional service staff, uncooked and spoilt food. Not even a single dish from the entire buffet spread was even decent. Don't go by the looks of the hotel and the ambience inside the restaurant. Would never recommend this to anybody in any situation."
3,"Food was average, not too many varieties for the buffet lunch. What you pay is what you get. No dish stood out. I found that chicken was too less in all the gravies. Lot of scope for improvement. I had been there on a Saturday, so there weren't much crowd. would recommend to family and friends if you want to have a pocket-friendly buffet lunch/ dinner."
1.5,To start on a positive note.. Good Ambience. Tats it ?There were hardly people guess just 2tables filled but still the service was tooo slow.Taste surely doesn't meet expectations. Really didn't feel good.Worst part They endorse for sizzler which actually is really bad... When they dont know to make it why to endorse about it. I had been there for sizzler but very disappointed. Sizzler was mere rice with vegetables n no binding sauce ??Bad choice!!!!
1,"Not good, we went for trying sizzlers-their so called specialty. It was pathetic. It was a bad choice on a good weekend evening. Will not visit again."
3.5,Good place.. Very nice service.. Yet the taste is not upto the mark.. We went on for a bday party.. They gave us a cake in regards which made us happy.. I give 3.5 for this place.. Can be better..
1,"This is worst restaurant I went in my life, the food is tooo..... Bad , I not getting any words to describe how bad it is. My request is please don't go to this restuarent.."
3.5,"Was staying @ Quality Inn, Shravanthi. This place is a restaurant in their basement. Had breakfast here for about 1 week daily. The service was good and the buffet was decent. I don't know if its worth the money as my meals were complimentary to the stay, but it never disappointed me in terms of the food."
1.5,We (12 member team) went for a Lunch Buffet today. None of us could cherish an item they served. Menu is very short with no variety. Food quality & quantity is not worth the price. Service is too bad. We had to wait so long for main course items as well. Decided to not to go again.rating is only for the ambiance.
3,It is some ok ok sort of restaurant. If you are really bored of all the restaurants around you then you can consider visiting this. Service is pathetic and ambience is good. Always items run out of stock and they delay much to replenish. Poor service.
2.5,Had lunch here the other day. The buffet was not the greatest for the price so ordered ala carte. The ambience is good but the service is bad. The food was not worth the price in quality and quantity. They need to ramp up big time if the want customers coming in. This is a good place for business lunches or a private conversation.
3,"So we ended up here on a late lazy Sunday afternoon breakfast.I ordered the paneer masala dosa and my friend ordered paddu.The dosa they make are really good crispy and a beautiful golden colour it has.I was expecting the aloo to be replaced to paneer masala as stuffing but it turned out to be paneer grated on to aloo masala.which I felt could have changed,the paddu took really long time but can't blame them because we went at around 12 for breakfast but when it came burnt on one side which they called it extra fry it was a disappointed .Must Try:Definitely the Masala dosa(Not paneer ;) and palak Paneer which we always order from this place(Keep it up)Paddu:50rs (6 pieces big one)Paneer masala dosa:70rsLocation:This is actually in Vijaya bank LayoutRating is based on truelly the above instance."
3,"Ambience - 3/5  Food - 4/5  Service 3/5  VFM - 4/5  Parking - NoneThis is a long pending review one of the popular Darshinis at Vijaya Bank Layout. Been there  for breakfast. They donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât have much of seating space, only a single bench and some standing tables.Food was good as expected. we had Mallige Idli,vada and Masala dosa. Food was good and tasty. IÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâd recommend this place for their breakfast if you happen to be nearby"
2,"I had to food home delivered.. delivery was done smooth and fast, but the food was awful.. the chicken burger patty was tasteless... very disappointedI was ought to give 1 star for the food but for the fast delivery I'm giving another."
4,it was good
5,itz very nyc goods n fresh too
5,good
3,I have order Veg burger and Fruit salad ice-cream. I did not like the taste of both. Burger pati was Lil hard to chew. As i have zomato treats i got feee Cold coffee which was so sweet that i couldn't finish it completely.
5,"Ordered through Zomato order .The Tisano Triple treat , its pretty yum and filling and definitely worth the price . 3 layers of chicken, egg and homemade mayo with a lil veggies made it a treat indeed :)Thumps up guys?"
3.5,Its a small food joint near gottigere. We tried their chicken cheese burger and it was pretty good. Easily better than the burgers served at burger king/ mcd and pocket friendly.
5,Good place to chill with your friends .. this little place always leaves me with a delicious experience. .. !! Small but awesome stocks of books.. . ????
5,"Well, its a place with a beautiful ambience..Good serviceAnd ofcourse their Friendly behaviour to all..So coming to the dishes.... its all worth itand a good taste.... i get always satisfied with the quantity.."

5,"Great taste & super quality  at reasonable  price , that's Tisano Cafe. Don't forget to try Tisano treat  and the milk shakes.. kudos to the good service too.."
4,Delivered before expected time. Rates are reasonable and the quality of food is good. Worth trying out a new place. Had a good experience. ?
5,Awesome burger available in this area. So yummy.. My choice is Jumbo burger..  Great services and staffs are so friendly.. I highly recommend everyone to visit TISANO CAFE once if you are in Bangalore.
5,"It is an excellent burger spot. Tried their Tisano Treat. - Simply Awesome!!. They also serve great milk shakes..!!Recommendation - Tisano Triple Treat, Spanish Mojo"

1.5,"When I call for delivery, they were behaved like non professionals?????????????????????????????????????????"
4,No particular parking place. Road side parking is available although. Ambience is good @ day time. Best hookas. Food is awesome. Odia cook but best Continental food. Price is good. Awesome mocktails and cold coffee. No alcohol. I will recommend it definitely.
3,"The location of this outlet is a bit isolated.The food is nevertheless amazing.It is a rooftop cafe.If you love spicy food,Definitely try instant regret chicken wings.It's damn spicy.Sizzlers are a must try (both veg and non veg)They don't serve alcohol at all.Loaded nachos were okayish. I didn't like the range of pizzas available.Lemon ice tea, peach ice tea, virgin mohito are good in drinks."
4,"Had paneer chilli, the pieces were soft and the dish tasted great (4.5/5)The waffle has a good taste with chocolate filled but the waffle was a little hard (3/5)"
4,"Was checking out places nearby and found cafe kabana. Budget friendly, good location, you have the hulimavu lake view from the cafe. They have got hookah options too, no alcohol though but you can smoke here."
5,"Absolutely love the place! Such simple and amazing food , which is something cafes are really missing now. The white sauce pasta is a must try and the chilli potato is also really tasty. And the staff is so humble and nice , itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs really welcoming! Oh and donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât forget to order the Kiwi Mint paan hookah!"
5,"Surprised me find a place like this this side of town, while I've been visiting the restaurant often I didn't realize they served breakfast and salads, I tried their English breakfast and tofu salad it blew me Away, the taste was excellent and the ambiance is just perfect with a spectacular view of the city skyline in the back drop! Must visit!"
5,This place is a hidden gem on Bannerghatta Road. It is very close by Royal Meenakshi Mall. It is a rooftop cafe with great ambience. Location is really awesome. You can see a lake from your seat if you have got one of those lucky seats in the corner.I ordered Loaded Fries and it was really good. They add some corn n tomatoes which gives a completely different flavor.I also ordered a Ferrero Shake from their special shakes menu and it was really awesome. The thick shake gave a different kick along with Hukkah.I ordered their Cafe Kabana Special Hukkah. It was a blend of some secret flavors. It was little mild but gave a different taste altogether. Must try flavor for Hukkah Lovers.Overall the ambience is top notch. You can't get anything better at this price on Bannerghatta Road.It is in my list of must try cafes in Bangalore.
1,Good ambience nice place to sit and relax.Location is a bit of a concern. Good things over now.Now the other sideOrdered1.chicken manchow soup - very average2.peri peri chicken - chicken wasn't fresh at allthough a nice place to have a conversation not recommended for food.
5,"This place won my heart!The service, food and what not. Everything was on time, in correct potion, properly cooked, nicely served.Hookah was attended frequently, best part pipe were changed along with coal. And the mix was just phenomenal.This place is going to get more visits for sure!!put the lift please."
5,Awesome set up on the rooftop. Its simple n welcoming. The ambiance just cools your nerves n chills your brain. A perfect place for you to hangout with your friends n chill after a looong week. The highlight of this place definitely are the sheeshas. They are just awesome. And the finger food and drinks served here are also too good. So head over to Cafe Kabana for an evening of fun with your friends and good food. Happy Fooding ?
4,"ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a decent place with good service and good Sheesha in the area, however the seating is not quite comfortable and the scope for food variance is also not that much but quality wise itÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs 3/5"
5,"Reasonably priced and tasty food. Perfect for a snack or two. I especially love the cutlets from this place. We had ordered chicken cutlet this time and by mistake they sent us veg ones. But they were kind enough to send us chicken ones later, late in the night. So good service by zomato and the restaurant. You know how to keep your costumers happy."
4,Lemme first look at this cheese cake again ?? i was loving it .. the taste was really cheesy cheese .. it was a blueberry one .. and i also tried chicken kabab hot dog ( If i am Not wrong with the name ) .. it was so filling .. the ambience was quite pleasant ?
3.5,"Nice ambience and a lot of good food on their menu like sandwiches, pizzas, chicken roll and burgers.They serve pastries and milkshakes too. Overall a good cozy place to drop by with family or friends for your evening snacks."
4,One of my favourite place for hangout. Second floor is really very cozy.... Delicious food and great smoothies. Cake is really tasty..... Especially the rainbow cake...
5,"Been here many times. Food-4/5, ambience-5/5, staff-5/5. I loved the lemon tea, it has become my favourite. Pocket friendly. Should visit if in surrounding area."
2,"Located in Bhagyanagar near the bus stop. Easily identifiable.Ambience: looks beautiful from outside and well as inside with greens around and tree house/pent house. Many seats are available and is peaceful. Usually ,the place isn't busy.Food: 1) Shezwan fried rice was not up to the mark and was oily.2)Baby corn Manchurian was very tasty and spicy. Must try.3) French fries was was okay okay, was served with fries and chilli powder was sprinkled on it.4) veg friend Momos, was very crispy and hard given with red spicy chutney.Service: was really bad and staff takes much time to serve the food."
3,"We ordered for Schezwan Paneer Sandwich Combo, Taste is good but I hardly find paneer, I hope they would increase quantity of paneer next time, Lemonade is ok, packing is good."
3.5,"Nice compact place with outdoor seating. Ordered veg momos, mc cain platter, virgin mojito. Food was good but not great. Need improvement in food taste. Presentation and quantity of food was good."
3,"The waffles are a bit dry and they look good but aren't as delicious in taste. I asked for a second serving of chocolate sauce, which they were happy to provide, but that too did not help.Try with some other toppings and you might have a better luck."
4,Wonderful place. Had Strawberry Hong Kong and Smoothies with my wife. It was delicious. I'm willing to try Chocolate and Oreo flavours once I visit again. Kudos!
3,"We went to the stall at Vega City Mall. The Oreo shake was good, the cappuccino was okayish. They can improve on the taste, I feel. It can get better with Service as well!"
4,This place is located in Vega City Mall and serves such amazing waffles that you can't hv them just once.The waffles are so tasty and yummy that you go into a different dimension altogether.The pricing is very reasonable.The staff was very courteous.
5,"One of the best wafel houses in Bangalore, an world wide wafle chain now in Bangalore, a wide variety of savouries and coolers to pick from, a completely unique menu , and lip smacking taste , the wafel sandwich was really crisp and on point,The nutella nuts too is highly recommended, i loved it's softness and taste, one of the best restaurants on the Vega City food court . A must visit place for the best wafles in town."
5,"A wide variety of delicious waffles are served here . Chocolate OMG is my favourite. Best waffles in town. They gives choice of waffles with ice cream scoops of any flavour, also sandwich waffle is worth tasting here for all salty tongues"
3,"We ordered for Egg Masala Omlette Combo, Taste is ok but not up to the mark, Bread quantity is very less ( 1 Small Slice of Bread ) they have to improve interms of Quantity & Taste."
3,Good to go place for healthy breakfast options. Its really economic and the ambience is good. Only thing strange about the place which i find is they dont keep water on table. You have to always keep asking for it.English breakfast and the sandwiches are a good option here. I wont prefer you to buy any drinks here because i dont think thats worth it. And the dessert option are also good but you have to be carefull of what you choose only go for some pastries and nothing else from that.According to me this place is only a good option for breakfast or some snacks.
3,"Decent cafe at Bannerghatta main road, Bangaluru. Good for quick breakfast. Opens at 8am which is a good point. I tried strawberry smoothie, chicken club sandwich and mixed sauce chicken pasta here. Pasta was very spicy but well made. Disappointed very much with the so called chicken club sandwich and a little disappointed with the strawberry Berry smoothie. The chicken sandwich was very desi.. They should not name it club sandwich. The strawberry smoothie was okay but again it was not exactly like a smoothie. It was more od strawberry ice-cream blended and hurrah we have a strawberry shake ???? I was disappointed so didn't so forgot to click the club sandwich. Then I realised I look so pretty and here you beautiful pictures of me eating breakfast. #MinistryofGourmet #gurgaonfoodie #breakfastdone #shiulichakravorty #reviewoftheday #foodiesofinstagramshiulichakravorty.com"
3,"Best place for breakfast. You will love the English breakfast but don't dare to drink cold coffee, it's disgusting. Sandwiches are good to try."
4,Nice ambience great service and nice milkshakesAnd a hot well presented coffeeRecommendedNot crowded as expected as per the ratingCompetetive Pricing
4,This newly opened Restro - Cafe is an amazing hangout place. This was formerly Cafe Fattoush. The place has a good variety of English breakfast. I tried the Spicy Chicken Burger. The food can be 3.5 /5. Ambience can be 4. Do catch up at this place.
5,"Amazing food ?...... loved their freakshakes ? and burger ? ........, will certainly visit again...pizzas and pastas ? are also good ...... staff is friendly and they also do home ? delivery ?"
4,"It is Okay place. This place is inside the Gopalan Innovation Mall, sitting is good, don't expect for privacy. Quality and quantity are as usual.A good place for breakfast with friends.Value of Money: 4/5Ambiance: 3/5Locaion: 5/5 (present on Gopalan Innovation Mall)Service: 5/5Service Time: 5/5"
3,Okay place !Coffee is normal not that great!I donÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât like their food items as they ever seem fresh ?Can always go for coffee though ?Service is good!
4,Who doesnt love CCD? I had this Devils own ditching my all time favourite Cafe Frappe.. Sorry Fav.. I have a new Favourite now.. such things are addictive isnt it?? Upon that the taste of icecream with your coffee ? Pure Bliss i must say! A lot did happen over my coffee today though!
3,Went to have dessert.its amazing and pocket friendly plus nice and small cafe.being small it gives u the cozy environment.so do try if u r near around it.
5,"The place shuts at 11 instead of the usual 1 A.M. like the other stores. Other than the seating inside, there's some additional seating right outside the store, which helps a bit. The wifi works well, the store isn't super busy. An ideal place to get some work done."
4,"Had been to Starbucks on a weekday afternoon. Cozy ambiance with nice music, friendly staff and freshly brewed coffee. Tried Cappuccino and Caffe Americano. Nice place to spend some time with coffee."
3,This smoor outlet is relatively newer one. There dine in area is more like a passage with just 5 to 6 high chairs. Currently they are serving only pasteries and chocolates. So i had red velvet naked cake and being a pista lover i had to try out Pista Passion. Both the desserts were good and moist.
3,"Smoor is one place where I love to indulge but this one let me down. First of all, it did not have intensive red velvet cake. Secondly, the seating is way too less and I had to wait before I could get a place. Only good enough to take away not to eat in."
4,"Newly opened place in Vega mall with most of the range of pastries and other baked products available. Yet they did not hv intensive red velvet cake.As other branches of smoor are, this place is also quite expensive but you can't beat the taste of the products here."
3,"The coffee is good and unique in taste, that I have to agree. But bun maska was quite dry. Anyway I think prices have also increased and now I don't feel that it is VFM anymore and hence, I am giving it a star less."
4,Went here on a Sunday evening. Been here many times but was surprised to see the prices being increased.They hv increased the range of their coffees as well as savouries along with them. I would say that the coffee is slightly over priced but still doesn't burn a hole in your pocket.Taste wise you get authentic tastes. The various variety you can check in the pics uploaded.
5,"If u love hooka , this is an awesome place to be. I love the food here. Tasty and love the hooka flavours .. a Have to visit place in Bangalore"
5,One of the best place to have seesha and enjoy with friends. Great atmosphere and ambience. They play live matches on large screen. Must go place.Can play games tooFood:5Ambience: 5
4,"I came here today and i totally love the ambience and the food here. They serve sheesha here too! An amazing place to be. Service is good and the staff is really friendship! It's open til 5AM, so hence a go to place for all the midnight cravings! I personally tried the chicken lolipop, Biryani and Fried Rice here. It's good! I would suggest if you are not a spicy food lover ask them to make it a little less spicy. Over all a nice experience ?"
4,"ItÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâs a good place in Bangalore for Hookah lovers and adding to that is amazing quality of food, be it non veg or veg , almost all tried items have been delicious as I have been to this place several times , however the ambience and seating have a scope for improvement !!"
1,"Worst food ever just ordered their baked veg pasta and 13 inches veg pizza. Had the worst experience the pasta was all watery and didnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât even seemed like a pasta, also the pizza was uncooked with stale vegetables. Shitty and expensive place waste of money and food. Never order from here."
2,"This place was mundane. We ordered few drinks, lasagne and pizza. The drinks were flavourless and the pizza was too dry. We ordered spinach and corn lasagne and were served vegetable lasagne. The ambiance wasnÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåât bad and probably recommended to sheesha lovers only."
5,"Very nice place to visit. They provide very different types of cuisine's such as sandwiches, burger, twisters and more. They also provide juice and milkshakes.If you are foodie and try too eat different things then must try cheese chocolate sandwich , fired oreo this item is damn fabulous you won't find any other place and also milkshakes.lastly twisters which are in different flavours.Please try this things once. You would love it."
5,A very good cafe.....with a variety of foods and drink.... Though ma personal fav is panner chilly sandwich..... Nd chesse maggie..... Nd with the drink....go for any. ...... .
4,"It is a small shop on Bannerghatta road.. Initially they started with a juice shop and then started serving snacks as well..We had tried many juices here... Like carrot, orange, kiwi, apple etc.. It was really very nice n fresh..Even sandwiches are good... Paneer Chilli grilled sandwich is very nice.. Customization is also possible.There is not enough place to sit.. But still you can go for takeaway or even home delivery option is available..Daily they will have different offers, different combos..A must try place!!"
5,A very good cafe.....with a variety of foods and drink.... Though ma personal fav is panner chilly sandwich..... Nd chesse maggie..... Nd with the drink....go for any. ...... All r grt.... A must try...bcos the price are so reasonable......a very clean cafe...nd the owners are very friendly.....A must visit......
5,"This is a genuine setup for homefood lovers. We have tried their regular thali and pasta.The regular thali, despite being of 55 bucks has a home touch with north style phulkas, homemade daal and less oil sabji. We have been frequently visiting the restaurant for over a week and never found any issues. Kudos to this place, it saves our money and protects you from eating oily stuff."
4,Nice place for contacting uples no one to troubleshoot best place in d top of the building should go and try this place no hookah that's the problem
5,i love the place and the food. pasta is too good here. also having a great ambiance. very place with a light music.  service is good. love to visit again and again.
4,"It's a really good place on the top floor, offering delicious continental food.its not much crowded, but has a wlcery big space around . Light music and pasta is very nice choice there. They have few of their special foods in chicken starters, you might feel it's a little expensive but it's a worth visiting place for food lovers."
1.5,"Would truly not prescribe to go . For the first few minutes no one at the counter, nothing on the shelves it was desserted expect that music was on . In the wake of meandering for some time there comes a man . We went for a quick bite ordered corn cheese chilly sandwich , samosa, cold coffee . Sandwich bread was noxious and samosa oil was trickling sadly these were the things which was accessible at 1pm . Nothing on the board was accessible . Not a happy customer"
4.5,"Liked the place, ambiance and food. As this is newly opened cafe need to be highlight this place little more. Open roof place under construction and hope next time that place will be completed."
4,"We went there on a thursday evening. Since the place was opened recently it was empty. Very nice ambience. We ordered chicken skewers, pepporonita pasta and pomegranate slush. The taste was impeccable. Especially Pasta. And price was of bit higher side. Service was very good. Will visit again."
4.5,"Really nice place with good service. Very interesting menu and curiously heavy on coconut in many of their options, not that I'm complaining. Would recommend the blueberry coconut smoothie, and the veg epinard al a creme for main course."
5,"Cafe Talk is most Serene and cool cafe where u can just drop in ...relax n have some fun time with friends,food is really delicious.. especially Red velvet cup cake and twisted samosa."
3.5,"I had been waiting for this cafe to open for a long time since it's on my way to office and i'm pretty fond of cafes. So yesterday i had been here with one friend. The ambience was nice and the interior decoration was simple but peaceful and artistic. Though they need to do something to close the window sheets completely when it's sunny :-P we ordered french toast and chocolate crepe. French toast was tasty, a little bit more egg in the toast would be even more welcome though ;-) chcolate crepe was also yummy, the suggestion in this case is to make the chocolate cream a bit thicker. The presentation and hospitality was appreciable. Overall, i would recommend this place for friends' hangout or even if u want to hangout alone casually. On new year they are planning to organise some guitar event which is for free, if anyone reads my review before that, you can plan to join this event :-)"
4,"It is a small cafe with big ambience. Place is decorated very nice. They have used each and every inches perfect. The wall paintings are appealing.The concept their is thick shakes under categories of Fruit base, Chocolate Base and Waffle Base. The chocolate ones are the best. I specially liked them. Fruit base which is called Frolicks is also good.They have Pizza, Sandwiches and Grills. The best one was Sandwich. Their Veg Chese is the best sandwich I ever had. Nothing can beat it.Overall the cafe is good place for Couples and Familly.Must try for chocolate lovers."
5,Very nice ambience. The look and feel of restaurant is very nice. They have yellow chairs which gives you throwback. Walls are painted very nice.Their speciality is chocoholicks. It is known as cad b in Pune amd Mumbai.Their sandwiches are the best i ever had.
4,"I used to visit this cafe almost evening during my office hours. Their frolicks are tooo delicious. Try their crusher, crunchy and choco rocks frolicks ;) Me and colleagues also tried their Sandwiches, french fries and garlic bread, everything was upto the mark. Now, i have to shift to new office so wont be able to visit this cafe. Staff is also very courteous."
5,"This place has the best stuffed paneer, chicken and churros in town with friendly staff, great service and amazing ambience! A must visit for sure if you stay close by!"
5,Amazing place to find delicious food with good ambience and reasonable priceMost try the churros which is the best with the homemade chocolate syrup ??
5,Totally loved the food very different and tasty food with a good service definitely will visit the place again dessert was amazing should definitely go if you guys are near vega city mall :)
4,Visited this place very recently and had the churros. They were very well made and were extremely soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Definitely a must visit place if you are in Vega city mall
5,"A small and a warm cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå© with lots of friendly vibes. Located near the delmia circle in JP Nagar is this newly opened Cafe with lots of potential. Yes, this is also pet friendly with a small section just for them!You can get whole lot of interesting books here to read or probably bring your own book of choice and enjoy with your food.Coming to the food, it was really good and they are always up for suggestions and feedback if it's not upto the mark.Some of my favorites were the nostalgia drink which is a unique combination of complan, hot chocolate and cocoa. Then the square shaped pizza's which were cheesy and very affordable as well. The pasta and sandwiches were also really good which was really soothing.All the bread is made in-house which is really soft and tasty.I'm giving an extra star just for the amazing service and hospitality given by the owners here. Definitely a must visit for people residing nearby JP Nagar area."
3,Nice place which a pet friendly nook inside the cafe ... there is no place for the dogs to play or walk around ... we ordered for burger which was unique but tasted ok and burji pav ... may or may not visit the cafe again ... they also have books if you wanna read ...
5,"Had a really great time at Slate Cafe, new outlet in JP Nagar. Aesthetic and very comforting ambience, The food was delicious and the staff was very hospitable, had a very positive experience in a long time, also it is pet friendly. Until next time, cheers! :)"
5,"Finally, A cafe where you can work in peace. They charge you for the time you spend and not for the food and drinks. Nice decors. They organise dance/aerobics classes on weekends as well. Overall a decent place to sit, relax and work without worrying to pay for coffee!"
4,"A place where you pay money for the time you spend rather than the food you eat. It's a concept where the money is paid for hourly basis. If you think in the monetary aspect this place is good. It's located in the main road of 15th cross and can be easily identified.Their ambience is really good. Feels like home. Ordered, coffee, egg sandwich, chilly garlic fried rice and honey chilly potatoes. Egg sandwich was done well. Fried rice was just delicious. Didn't expect that amazing flavour and taste from a cafe. Honey chilly potato was also up to the mark.If you are a person who wants to spend time alone with your work or a book this place would be perfect. A lot of meetings happen here. Theatre artists come here and spend time. They do have a carrom board where you can play games.Loved their concept. Good food + good ambience+ good concept= best place to hangout with your loved one."
5,"One of the best places for launches, workshops or just Ur space to work in.Ambience: loved it! So open and spacious. They have this place just for conducting whatever you want, on pre-booking it. A very well lighted room with a lot of bean bags around.Food and beverage: good! Even the quantity is so apt.Service: very polite, timely staff.All in all, an amazing place to work in or just to hang out."
5,"My favorite cafe cum co-working space in Bangalore. The place is peppy with the vibrant interiors and furniture. The breezy outdoor seating and the cozy indoors are the star attractions of this place. The facilities include high speed wifi, calm environment, an active community, snacks and beverages, books to readÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ andÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ. You can bring your home cooked foodÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâ. Tada! Isn't that great! "
1,"Well, They expect you to pay them for the time you spend there! They don't have a pricing on their Menu!! Thats weird! Especially days with events like story telling or so, you buy what they ask you to buy! They expect you to pay 150/- For a snack and lemonade, and claim food is complimentary. Weird and Funny! The Manager has the audacity to say, we charge you for the time here! Well, then folks, mine's more precious than yours! Agios Amigos!"
2,The pizza tastes good but the quantity showed in the picture and given is totally opposite. The layer of the Pizza including topping was so thin. I would never recommend this cafe if u are a foodie. U'll be disappointed for sure. It's not worth the money!!!
5,"I had been to this place. Tried new varieties of pizza, one can get authentic taste of italian food at reasonable price here. Good place to take family too. Must try."
3,"Shady, Untidy and Shabby. Was there with old friends for shisha. Ambiance resembles to a shady 90's bar. Only good aspect was very fewer people on weekend. They have booths for 4-5 people, more than 5 people have to cramp and sit.The only thing good was their Shisha which was one on one free which were really amazing.Then came a series of disappointment ordered pasta, Oreo and KitKat shake and cheese maggi. Pasta was bland, shakes were watery and cheese maggi was watery maggi with sprinkles of cheese and they billed 25 rupees extra for already costly 140 rupees maggi (not even 20 rupees maggi). On asking about the poor quality of food they said it wasn't the branch of mud pipe hence food is not nice but was just a franchise of mud pipe.My advice go to the other mud pipe only if you have no option then go to this place"
4,"Visited on a weekday evening. Less crowd hence quicker service. We tried a bunch of starters such as baby corn dry fry, mushroom chilli etc along with hookah."
4,"Dropped in here on a Friday evening. They have creative options for the hookah and it is worth trying out. Food is also good especially the sizzlers which is an entire meal by itself (pasta, fries, fried rice, spring role,grilled veggies in mushroom and spicy tangy sauce.The ambience needs a bit of an improvement as the sofas are very dirty. Otherwise a good place ??"
3,"It's a bungalow converted into cafe having outdoor garden sitting as well as indoor sittingThey have there own bakeryFood and drinks we just ok nothing so special !It seems they take small party orders as wellIf u want quite n serene ambience , then this is the place for u in that part of townFood 3/5.Ambience 3.5/5Service 3.5/5Pricing 3.5/5Overall 3/5"
4,A cute little cafÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌÄåÄÌÄåâÌâå© to relax and enjoy some coffee and food. Just like any other regular cafe.The chicken nuggets and fries are good!The ambience is lovely too. A bit pricey for the quantity but definitely worth a visit.
4,"Though I see this place almost everyday never bothered to try it..finally today got the opportunity and I must admit this is a great option if you want to grab a quick bite along with a cold or hot beverage. Menu is simple an option of veg and non veg quick bites, salads and soups, sandwiches & burgers, pasta and pizzas.We had the broccoli soup, veggie salad, veg burger and a veg pizza along with lime soda. Service is reasonably quick, food is yummy and portions adequate. Loved the veg pizza. Service is friendly and there is both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements. Will definitely recommend and will revisit."
3,"Well..the place has an outside sitting and an inside sitting as well..Like many Banglorean restaurants the place is a house converted into a cafeThe ambience was nice in garden and the service was quick.Food..I was lured by Desserts pics... Food was not that great but I loved the rainbow pastry.(forgot the name :P) , the chicken starter was not that great. Grilled sandwich was okishIts a nice place if u want hangout with friends and chit chat.Ambience :3.5Service :4Food :2.5"
4,"This residential house turned into restaurant is located on the busy roads of JP nagar. The lawn is converted has the sit out area, for which my full marks goes. Have tasted chicken puff, egg puff, pastry and pasta here. This is one of our regular visit adda quiet and calm place. Service and taste is also satisfactory."
5,Such a niceeeee place I visited after a long time which wasn't planned and yet was so good in every aspect. Food was amazing specially the lasagnia. Spinach lasagnia is the best lasagnia I ever had!! The ambience was quite and old school. It had such a soothing vibe to it that you would want to go again and again. In love with this place.
5,"It's a beautiful little place in a quiet corner. Very aptly named! I ordered chicken sandwiches and some pastries, was very delighted by both! The restrooms were well maintained as well. Kudos!"
4,"Been to this place with 6 friends and were catching up after 6 months so this place was ideal as there were very few ppl and we got an opportunity to make all the noise. Well we ordered some short eats, cakes, muffin, pizza and pastas. Quantity was big enough for all of us. Service was slow since we were not in a hurry it helped us otherwise they came to take order after nearly 30mins. Everything we ordered was tasty and nice. Best place to hang out with friends.Rate wise I feel it's slightly on higher side."
4,Great food. Good ambience. Service is a little slow. Lot of mosquitoes in the evening. The spacing between tables is very good . Overall a nice place for a quiet and peaceful evening .
4,"Lovely place and a lovely ambience with loads of space. This is a very good burger place. The meat is usually fine minced that they use. The Bun is very different and is flavoured as well. I would have preferred a lot more veggies as well which is a bit scarce. The drinks are decent. The service is a bit laid back depending upon the flow of customers. A warmer welcome would do more good. Having said all this, the place still beats MacD or Burger King in the overall taste vs price rating."
4,"Probably my favourite place for burgers as of now. This place is my preferred place for working with buddies, brainstorming sessions and a lot more work and fun. You can get a variety of burgers, shakes and much more here. The burgers are juicy, the fries crispy and shakes so thick that makes you want more. Only bummer being that the service takes a lil while longer than you can expect normally. Price wise, not so bad but a bit on the expensive side.Overall a good place to hang around with friends and co workers. Good food, ambience and a decent value for money."
3,Actual rating: 3.5It's a delivery order. I've tried only the Veg. Grilled exotic and the choco brownie shake. Both were equally good. Will definitely try more from this place.

4,"RATED Intended Rating: 4.5/5Biggie's burger is one of my favourite burger joints. They have exquisite range of burgers both veg and non veg. The burgers are very different from the regular ones. Must visit burger joint. They also have hot dog, fries, wedges, shakes and mojito's.? Ambiance:This outlet is huge compared to the other outlets. It's very spacious and has indoor and outdoor seating. The decor is quite catchy and lit well.? What I had:? Chicken Cheese Beast: This is the best burger I have had. The chicken patty is filled with cheese inside. The cheese oozes out of the burger at just a bite.? Veg Exotic: amazing blend of Mushroom n Paneer patty with grilled veggies and cheese.? Cuban Classic Mojito: very fruity and refreshing. Just goes well with the hot fresh burgers.Ambiance: 4/5Food: 4/5Service: 4/5Price: 4/5"
